Well, we try to use Dwarven Forge and the compatible Psomminiature scenery with our mini's for the fights. It takes some time to set up, though, and since we're playing at a friend's house, I can't do that in advance, so that factor actually slows us down a bit. I have a pretty nice collection of scenery pieces which are stored in plastic boxes, but that also implies that I have to open maybe five boxes to set up one encounter.I also painted some mini's especially for this campaign last summer, but I don't have a good camera yet to take pictures. Maybe in the future ... These figs are also spread out over several boxes, so while it is great to expand your personal collection of miniatures and scenery, it has one disadvantage: the more material you have, the longer it takes to find what you need.
