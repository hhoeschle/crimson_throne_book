Poor Lick, will his torments never end? :)\\

Nice... very nice! It makes me very happy to see some of the names from my game returning in this one as well! :) You're doing a great job making things fit together, intertwining various story elements. I hope your players are enjoying it!\\

Even if they aren't, it's a pleasure to read this as another ex-GM of this campaign. I'm very curious how you will present the rest of the campaign.\\

By the way, are your players reading this thread? How cautious must we be regarding spoilers?\\
