For me, this was one of the best rpg'ing experiences ever. I truly enjoyed it, and my players complimented me on it, so they loved it as well.The speech was pre-written, because improvising such a thing never turns out quite as well. So I write this kind of thing in advance. The first time I did this was back in the Shackled City AP: in Moonbeam wrote: I was also amazed that the PC's sent their money on such a thoughful gift for the queen, instead of keeping it to upgrade their gear. That's unthinkable for most parties! The gift actually isn't all that expensive, a couple of hundred GP. We're having a lot more 'fun' with taxes. Even the flat 10 % rate proves to be hard to meet. If only we were so lucky in real life!
