It was truly a great achievement in roleplay. How Quint solely entered the lion's cage, used the priestess' ambitions against her, implied things never spoken aloud and quoted the dogmas of the church as if the 'inquisitor' was there himself when the Dark Prince wrote them on the backs of his most devout followers...\\

This session will not lightly be forgotten. Thanks Quint!\\
