\section{30 Erastus 4703}

The next couple of weeks the lambs are kept busy. Sjo, Balian and Quint have to work in the harbor, cleaning the hulls of ships, an arduous and dangerous job.\\

The evening of the 30th Alika takes "The Korvosa Herald"' home, a printed newsletter that is published once a fortnight. She asks Balian to read it to her, while she starts carving another wooden puppet. The Herald announces the up-and-coming wedding of the king to the Chelaxian noblewoman he met in the market, Ileosa Arvanxi. The marriage is planned for the 31st of Arodus, on the holiday of Saint Alika. The back of the Herald traditionally covers a piece of history, focusing on Korvosa's early battles with the Shoanti. Sjo feels a bit sour when he learns that the Sable Company was founded by a handful of veteran soldiers who had survived the Shoanti attacks. By the time Balian has finished reading, he sees the sculpture his sister has carved: the new queen.\\
