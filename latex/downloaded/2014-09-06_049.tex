My players hated Ishani, because he couldn't heal Brienna. I tried point out that it wasn't that he couldn't it was that he was forbidden from doing so. If he tried, the magic wouldn't work unless he was paid for it because that's one of Abadars decrees.\\

Still, despite all that, they blame him, Ishani, instead of Abadar. It's carried far enough that they don't allow clerics or NPCs of Abadar in their campaigns except as antagonists.\\
