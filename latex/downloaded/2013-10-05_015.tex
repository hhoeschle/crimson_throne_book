During last night's session I realized I made a mistake in the journal. Professor Fordyce' wife belongs to house Leroung, not house Jegarre, which stems from gentleman-explorer Montlarion Jeggare. Of course it is very plausible that the Leroung and Jegarre family in Korvosa have intertwined a couple of times over the last three centuries, so Montlarion Jegarre probably ranks among Eliasia Leroung's ancestors as well.\\
