Question, did none of the derro use their {\itshape darkness} SLA? When my party encountered Vreeg, they had a horrible time with him due to  {\itshape darkness} and him flying around the room. Only the dwarf in the party could see him, but the room was too big to for him to be hit (I decided all the rooms were 15 ft high unless stated otherwise).
