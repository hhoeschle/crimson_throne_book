For my Harrow readings I use the Paizo Harrow Cards and an excel worksheet that I found somewhere on these boards, which tells you what each card means. If you don't have the cards, you can easily use the worksheet by itself, because it does an automatic spread for you.For the reading, base yourself on the official explanation of each card (easy with the excel worksheet) and mix in what you know about your PCs' background, present character or future events. If you're having an extremely hard time at divining the meaning of each card during play, you could even consider doing the reading via e-mail. It will give you more time to think harder about how to express yourself. I decided to do my reading at the table, though, because they provide a marvelous opportunity at roleplay.
