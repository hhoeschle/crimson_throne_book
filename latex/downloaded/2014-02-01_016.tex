Wow, so much happened lately! It's very cool for your players that you're giving them such an active role in the campaign, instead of merely being Field Marshal Kroft's underlings. Getting the cool new house seems quite interesting. Are you guys going to let it deployed in your friend's house throughout the entire campaign, or do you need to dismantle it and re-build it for each game?\\

I think it's cool that your PC's get to interact with the movers and shakers of the city so early. How are they liking it?\\

Quint seems to really be the "face" of the group, are the other PC's getting their chance to role-play as well?\\

I also enjoyed seeing some familiar names in there... Mouse, Heldrin (not a dwarf anymore!) and Korwick. ;)\\

A more spoilery question... definitely one your players should not read.\\

 Because one of the options I considered when preparing the campaign was to actually make Ileosa a victim: that she wasn't a bad person at the core, but just got possessed by the spirit of Kazavon, who was the true responsible for the atrocities that happened. And then in the last adventure, the heroes would've had a chance to save/redeem Ileosa.\\

Another option I considered was that they would defeat the real Ileosa, but what about her clones... Like the one in the pyramid in the last adventure? What if *they* could be redeemed?\\

In the end, I remained closer to the campaign as written, mostly because I guessed that my players didn't share the soft spot I have for this villain, and they would probably find it more rewarding to just kill her and anything even remotely resembling her.\\
