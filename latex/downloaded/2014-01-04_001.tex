Wow, I love the rooms you've built for the miniatures. That seems to really add a great deal of visual immersion to the gaming experience. Does it take a long time to set these things up?\\

Are you able to re-use a lot of the same walls, furniture, etc, without it getting too visually repetitive?\\
