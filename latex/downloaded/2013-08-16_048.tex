When the party gets back to Lamm's former hideout, the kids have already got rid of much of the smelly fish offal and are scrubbing the floors fervently. Sjo notices that one of the lambs never speaks. The boy, who wears a hood that partly hides his face, is extremely introvert. Kester says that this is Lerrim and that they shouldn't worry about him too much; he's always like that. The five boys are close friends and always take care of each other. Their bond includes the silent Lerrim, even if he never speaks.\\

Kester also adds that Lerrim is like Sjo, a Shoanti. He was brought in years ago and got severely beaten multiple times when he didn't understand what he was supposed to do, since he only spoke the barbarians' tongue. In the beginning he still uttered that language; although Kester never knew what he was saying, it was obvious that it weren't very nice things. This usually led to even more beatings, so in the end the boy just kept quiet to avoid punishment. Now, after so many years he has learned to understand common, but he still refrains form speaking.\\

Quint says something in the Shoanti's language, drawing Lerrim's attention for a second, but the boy quickly averts his gaze again. It will take more than a few words spoken to snap him out of his shell.\\
