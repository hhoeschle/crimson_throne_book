Wow, this is really good stuff. Your players will be a lot more immersed in the story when you begin the first adventure now that they've had an actual taste of Gaedren Lamm's evil.\\

How are the mechanics for these young pre-adventurers working out for you? Did you take the adult version of the characters (level 1) and then applied some penalties to some stats, and made them of Small size?\\
