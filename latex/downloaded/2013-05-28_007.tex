Thanks for the compliment. The prelude sessions serve to give the players a heart-felt hatred of Lamm, but also to make Korvosa feel more like home and to foreshadow some NPCs.The mechanics for the kid versions: Because of the simple weapon proficiency the PCs had a chance to hit something, so the fights that were actually very simple, were fun anyway. Still, enemies hit easily as well because of the low AC the PCs have.
