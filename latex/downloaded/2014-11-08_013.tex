Happy to hear that you're still reading and you still like the story.\\

It is one of the things I find most difficult when reading other journals - remembering who all the characters and NPCs are - which is why I hope the pictures help to get an image of the PCs and some of the settings. Still, there are a lot of characters in this story, so yeah, it might get hard sometimes. It certainly helps to be familiar with the AP, because then you can at least tell those NPCs apart (like Kroft, Orisini, Trinia, Tuttle, Ornelos, Arkona, d'Bear ...).\\

I also understand the fact that you do not write a comment every time you read a new entry. I read some other journals myself, and even though I try to leave a note at least once, I do not do so every time - far from it. I only speak up when I have something to say or to ask. Still your little comment was appreciated. I hope you'll enjoy what I have in mind for my group. If things work out as planned, there should be good times for years to come ...\\
