The final discussion on whether Ossy Applebottom has actually done anything illegal or not, actually lasted for about an hour and a half. I just wrote down the gist of it.At one point I even burst out laughing, remembering similar sessions when we had captured enemies alive and discussed at length what to do with them before someone finally got tired of it and simply bashed in the prisoners' heads. Still, Applebottom's chances look slightly better and I actually believe he might survive.
