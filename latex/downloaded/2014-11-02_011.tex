In the absence of other former regular posters, please let me just tell you that I am still eagerly following this journal. As I have not played the Adventure Path myself, sometimes it is a bit hard to keep track of all the characters poppin up now and then but I guess the interaction with so many various NPCs is just what makes this AP stand out from the others and has arguably turned it into the most popular of all APs. Kudos to you as the DM for fleshing them out even more and establishing closer connections to the PCs as this makes the setting come so much more alive. Looking forward to the next entry!\\
