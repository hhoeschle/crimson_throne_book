This session was a lot of fun, first of all because the fight itself was very cool. The halfling's swinging jump that saved little Korwick was very spectacular and Quint's luck in avoiding any damage was epic.\\

Secondly, the session provided some much needed closure. I have been feeding my players a number of red herrings , trying to foreshadow people or events. Of course, these red herrings can amount to too many unsolved cases: there was the Rolth thread, which won't be solved until much later; there was the artists' suicide storyline and then there was the unfinished business with Gaedran Lamm.\\

I already pointed out to my players that they shouldn't explore the artists' suicides any longer; we spent two sessions doing that. These sessions provided some very nice background information and interesting social contacts in the city, but the PCs were never supposed to solve this mystery. So it was no use continuing this wild goose chase.\\

The PCs also know that Rolth has left the city now, so they won't pursue this storyline anymore until I open it up again.\\

The only case that I could let them solve right now, was their vengeance on Lamm. So I decided not to postpone their new confrontation with Gaedran Lamm any longer and give my players one decent chance at closure. The fact that the session played out so nicely was a bonus!\\
