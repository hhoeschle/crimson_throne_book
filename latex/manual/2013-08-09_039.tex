% Cast of characters:\\

% - Sjo (short for Shaoban): human oracle 1 (flame mystery), of Shoanti blood;   Lick, now Lucian Lycan, is an NPC, a former fellow lamb. He is now an artist with an inspiration that borders both on genius and madness. He works as a playwright and actor at Pilts Swastel's Exemplary Execrables.\\

% Here are their stats. I hope I got them right, they include some houserules. You might note that the former lambs have three traits. That is because I 'forced' two traits on them and allowed them to choose one for free. Puk only has two traits, but these were both free choices.\\
