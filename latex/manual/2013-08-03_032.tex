% Last night we started the true AP, five years after the prelude sessions.\\

% We were joined by a fourth player, a stranger I found over the internet. He truly is a 'stranger', not only because we didn't know him before, but also because he is a foreigner, hailing from a neighboring country. Although he is still learning our language, he can understand it quite well thanks to the fact that they are related (we speak Dutch and he is German, both Germanic languages).\\

% It turned out to be an enjoyable session and our first experience with the new player was very successful. I would like to take this opportunity to officially welcome him again, Hanspeter, Herzlich willkommen!\\
