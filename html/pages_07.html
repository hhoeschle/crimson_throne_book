                The next morning the companions gather for breakfast. Thousand Bones greets them and asks if they are ready for the journey. Off to the side, an older Shoanti woman is cooking up something hearty in a large pot. Suddenly a screech tears through the air. The sound seems to be coming from the north and ends close to the breakfast circle. The elderly cook buckles and tumbles to the ground, a bolt sticking from her neck. Out of thin air two red mantis assassins appear and attack the unwary party. Wicked-Claws, the wingless dragonne that protects the tribe, rears its scaly head when it sees a big leopard charging from behind one of the tents.

                 In no time the Shoanti camp is in complete chaos.
                </a>
                Puk tries to get the people to hide in the tents, but panic has taken a hold of them, which makes some of them run around wildly instead of hide. The scarlet-clothed assassins are both joined by giant-sized red mantis insects and a few seconds later two other large monsters burst from the sand: these abominations have the upper body of a human, while their lower half is that of a humongous scorpion. Their deadly claws and poisonous stingers flash left and right, damaging Balian, but also making some casualties among the Shoanti commoners. Sjo tries to pinpoint the source of the ranged attack and finds it when three screaming bolts plant themselves in his chest, causing grievous wounds: a hitman is hiding behind a big rock off to the north. The pin-cushioned healer already has to resort to his magical cures. Thousand Bones’ venerable age has made him a fragile man, but he still possesses some powerful magic, and attempts to
                <i>
                 dispel
                </i>
                one of the summoned mantises. The insect pops away as suddenly as it appeared. Quint takes up his support role and casts
                <i>
                 haste
                </i>
                . Meanwhile Balian, Spyder and Puk launch their melee attacks and dish out serious damage. Puk already manages to slay one of the assassins and sees him poof away in red smoke as he falls. Saamesh, the rescued spy, also joins the fray, but his defenses are far inferior to the party’s, so he suffers greatly. Balian confronts a scorpionman, bearing down on him again and again with his greatsword. The creature loses three limbs in the attack, but still has enough legs left to stand and return the attack. It is aided by the sudden appearance out of nowhere of yet another Red Mantis assassin, a killer whose armor’s shape suggests that she is female. She delivers a vicious blow to the ranger. The surviving giant mantis turns on Saamesh, who bears the beating stoically, but falls to the ground when a bolt from the mysterious archer hit him hard. Another shot takes down Balian.
               </p>
               <p>
                With two fighters out of the game, it is time for some battlefield control: Sjo freezes the female assassin in place with
                <i>
                 hold person
                </i>
                , but the archer resists a similar spell and a
                <i>
                 cacophonous call
                </i>
                from Quint. Next the bard makes the campfire explode in a bright flash, which blinds the male assassin, a scorpionman and the leopard, who is locked in combat with Wicked-Claws behind the main tent. Spyder suffers the same fate, but uses his instinct to continue his attacks anyway with surprising ease; naturally the blinded opponents try to do the same. Thousand Bones moves closer to
                <a href="http://mrvergee.deviantart.com/art/The-Cinderlander-from-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-603327133?q=gallery%3AMrVergee%2F38801006&amp;qo=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
                 the source of the deadly bolts and recognizes the Cinderlander hiding behind a rocky outcropping.
                </a>
                The old medicine man finally manages to neutralize the danger by casting another
                <i>
                 hold person
                </i>
                on him, which finally succeeds. Meanwhile Puk takes out a first scorpion creature and deals heavy damage to the frozen female assassin. The wingless dragonne leaves the sight-robbed leopard groping in the dark and turns on the second giant mantis. Gushing blood from one of his wounds, unconscious Balian is in danger of bleeding out, so Sjo helps his friend with a
                <i>
                 cure critical wounds
                </i>
                . Quint and Thousand Bones provide further healing for the ranger, who tries to regain his feet. Despite his blindness Spyder manages to kill the female assassin next, who disappears in a puff of red smoke as well. Puk presses the final Red Mantis murderer, who takes down Sjo in turn. Fortunately Thousand Bones is close to lend assistance, one healer to another. Spyder continues his streak of good luck and finishes off the final assassin. Apparently the outdoor environment of the Cinderlands agree with the city dog. As the assassin pops away in red clouds, the giant mantis he summoned disappears as well. The only immediate threat left is the second scorpionman; the Cinderlander is still frozen in place and his blinded leopard pet is trying to find its way back to its master. Puk and Balian turn on the foul scorpion critter, drawing blood from many wounds, but still the creature persists and snaps and stings at the ranger with success as well. Fortunately Balian possesses enough fortitude to resist the poison. Puk is no big fan of the almost spiderlike way in which the giant scorpion creeps about, but with Balian providing flanking, he can duck between the creature’s many legs and deliver the final blow.
               </p>
               <p>
                Wasting no time, Balian charges over to the Cinderlander before the man manages to regain control of his movements. Wicked-Claws is close behind, chasing the leopard back to the archer, who finally breaks out of the
                <i>
                 hold person
                </i>
                , but is laid low by another of Thousand Bones’s spells. The old Shoanti
                <i>
                 commands
                </i>
                the Cinderlander to ‘grovel’, making the enemy fall prone in the dirt.

                 A storm of attacks from all sides ends his life.
                </a>
                By the time Sjo arrives it is already over, the Cinderlander is dead. So this deadly opponent was his biological father, was he? The healer cannot muster any pity for the man, but still sends him off with a short prayer to Pharasma. That is all the mercy this killer deserves.
               </p>
               <p>
                Quint turns to Thousand Bones and says he is very sorry. This attack was aimed at his party, and it cost five innocent Shoanti bystanders their lives. Thousand Bones accepts his apology and says that at least one good thing came of it: the Cinderlander, who has been plaguing the Shoanti for almost two decades, is finally defeated. It is a sad day for the tribe, but a good day or all the clans in general. The victims will be honored as heroes and their names will live on in song and legend.

                An hour after the Red Mantis ambush the companions leave the Skull Clan camp, joined by both Thousand Bones and Saamesh. After about half a day of traveling the party comes across another group of Skoan-Quah warriors, who are making their way to the shadow of the Great Flame as well. Like the members of Thousand Bones’ tribe, they are following the call of the Sklar-Quah. The Burn riders who recruited them are still with them and do not seem overly pleased with the presence of Korvosan
                <i>
                 tshamek
                </i>
                , but they accept the company of the strangers when Thousand Bones and Saamesh vouch for them.
               </p>

                <b>

                </b>
               </p>
               <p>
                Over the next two days the group traveling with the heroes grows even more, to about 250 men and women. By the end of the afternoon on the third day they finally reach their destination: an imposing pinnacle of red rock that rises from the earth to a height of more than 200 feet. Millennia of erosion have shaped the stone like a big flame. In normal times this landmark would be an eye-catcher, but now Balian finds his gaze being drawn to the enormous encampment at its foot. Hundreds of tents and campfires cover the landscape.
               </p>
               <p>
                Upon approaching the camp the companions see a delegation of Burn Riders moving in to welcome the newcomers. Puk immediately recognizes the giant that leads them: Krojun Eats-What-He-Kills. When he spots the companions, the barbarian gives them a small frown, but as soon as he picks out Saamesh in the crowd, the towering Shoanti jumps off his horse. With big strides he closes the distance between himself and the former spy. Grinning widely, he pulls his much smaller friend in a bear hug: “Brother, have you come to join us in battle? My heart rejoices, you are more than welcome!” he smiles. “Although I see you have not brought the best of companions”, he continues, nodding at the Korvosans.
               </p>
               <p>
                Saamesh returns the heartiness of the hug, but when he frees himself from the giant’s grip, he replies: “On the contrary, brother, my business in Urgir did not end well. These men saved me from the deadly clutches of the orcs. With the exception of you, perhaps, I cannot imagine being in finer company.”
               </p>
               <p>
                Krojun grins at the party: “Then I welcome you as well, welcome to the brave warriors who will crush Korvosa and see justice done.”
               </p>
               <p>
                Krojun leads Thousand Bones, Saamesh and their Korvosan guests to a huge tent, bordering the foot of the Great Flame. While they make their way through the camp, the companions feel the hostile gaze of hundreds of Shoanti. The forces that have gathered here are truly impressive: there must be over two thousand warriors here, if not three; hundreds of horses and Puk even spots a number of mastodons, immense eliphants. The halfling stares at the titans in awe: “Look, oliphaunts, no one at home will believe this!”
               </p>
               <p>
                The war-
                <i>
                 yurt
                </i>
                is the biggest tent the companions have ever seen, fully covered in animal skins and leather hides. In front of the entrance there are two rows of totems, decorated with different animals and symbols. A plume of smoke rises from a hole in the center of the tent. Quint quickly cleans up everyone’s attire with
                <i>
                 prestidigitation
                </i>
                , casts
                <i>
                 glibness

                upon himself and
                <i>
                 tongues
                </i>
                on Puk and Balian, who do not speak Shoanti. Krojun motions for the newcomers to enter. Inside a few dozen men and women are gathered around a bonfire. Most of them look like experienced warriors, but others bear the symbols and ornaments of mystics. Upon entering Krojun’s loud voice booms out: “Honored
                <i>
                 jothka’s
                </i>
                and wise fathers and mothers, we have welcomed many guests in our midst of late, but these visitors will surely draw your attention!”
               </p>
               <p>
                Everyone inside eyes the Korvosan heroes with a mixture of surprise and contempt. A broad-shouldered warrior with gray hair and a proud beard seems to share these feelings, but when Saamesh steps into the tent behind Balian, his face lights up. He walks up to the young man, places his hands on the spy’s shoulders and calmly speak in a very low voice: “So, son, you have finally turned your back on that stinking orc pit. Your father’s heart leaps at your return.”
               </p>
               <p>
                “Jothka”, Saamesh answers with the same calm, “the orcs of the Hold of Belkzen are strong and many, but their eyes are not aimed at the Quahs right now. I was less lucky, however, and personally got to experience their false gazes and sharp claws. If it wasn’t for these men, you’d be short one son.”
               </p>
               <p>
                The bearded man turns to the companions, looking each of them in the eye: “I offer you my thanks, tshamek. My name is Valkur Burns-In-His-Veins, the Quahjothka of the Sklar-Quah. I am the one who has called together the Shoanti to drive your people back into the sea. I take it that is why you are here. Speak, and we will listen.” Quint recognizes the word Quahjothka as the ‘chief’, not just of a single tribe, but the ‘chief of chiefs’ of a complete clan or Quah. This man is the head of all the Sun Clan people.
               </p>
               <p>
                Valkur points to an empty place next to the fire where his guests can sit down. He squats on the ground a few yards further, between four other important-looking Shoanti: Laaron Strongbow, Quahjothka of the Lyrune-Quah (the Moon Clan), Fidru Glides-On-The-Wind, daughter of the Quahjothka of the Shriikiri-Quah (the Hawk-Clan), Akbat Whose-Tongue-Gives-Life, Quahjothka of the Shundar-Quah (the Spire Clan) and Durbeth Lifebreath, Quahjothka of the Skoan-Quah (the Skull Clan). The other Shoanti inside the war-yurt sit down as well, curious to witness this intriguing encounter. Krojun, Thousand Bones and Saamesh are among them, as is One-life, the chief of Thousand Bones’ tribe.
               </p>
               <p>
                The companions also introduce themselves and Quint explains why they are here. After the death of King Eodred, the ‘Quahjothka’ of Korvosa, his wife Ileosa took control and has been showing ever more apparent signs of evil and madness. The party has tried to counter this malevolence, but they found themselves insufficiently equipped or skilled to succeed, especially after Ileosa displayed virtual immortality when she was shot in the head by an accomplished warrior who had discovered her evil as well. The arrow to her temple should have felled an auroch bull, but instead it hardly phased her, as she simply plucked the bolt from her head and attacked the warrior with it. The ‘feeble’ Korvosan woman grabbed the seasoned warrior by the throat and lifted the 200 pound man off the ground as if he were a twig, killing him with one single blow. The companions now suspect that the queen is under the influence of the ancient ‘evil’ that was supposedly buried under the mastaba. If she is not stopped, queen Ileosa will destroy both of their people, Quint continues, referring to Thousand Bones’ spirit quest and the vision of the shadow dragon swallowing the Shoanti horses and Korvosan wolves alike, leaving no one alive. “That is why we have come: to learn more about this evil and find out how they can fight it.”
               </p>

                Quint also knows that the Shoanti are wary of outsiders and only truly accept their own: other (full-blood) Shoanti or – on very rare occasions – non-Shoanti who have proven themselves worthy. That entails that the companions will have to try and acquire enough of the Shoanti’s respect through their past deeds. So the bard spins a story of who the party is and what they have achieved. Sometimes he finds it hard to explain, because many urban concepts are foreign to his audience. The Shoanti do have a word for children who’ve lost their parents, but the words lacks the undertone of being abandoned as the term ‘orphan’ does, because the tribes always take care of such children. His listeners also frown when Quint describes the many excesses of ‘corruption’ he and his friends have fought over the last couple of months in Korvosa, probably reinforcing the wildlings’ prejudice that so-called civilized society is actually anything but civilized and definitely not honorable. Throughout his tale Quint makes sure to point out that his party does not seek to cause conflict, but they do not avoid it when it slaps them in the face. Although they prefer a peaceful solution, they will resort to violence if necessary.
               </p>
               <p>
                Sjo supports Quint’s story by singling out the deeds he and his friends have accomplished that involved Shoanti. He shows the token of friendship they received from Thousand Bones when they provided aid in dire circumstances in the city of Korvosa, he recounts the time they freed an ancient Shoanti tumulus of vile bugbear intruders and offers the medallion they retrieved from that tomb to Akbat Whose-Tongue-Gives-Life, the Quahjothka of the Shundar-Quah, whose ancestors were buried there. He also points out that he and his friends took the shape of natural animals in their journey to the spirit world, which indicated that their hearts were in the right place, and connects that vision quest to the rescue of Saamesh from the orc city of Urgir. He ends his intervention with the defeat of the Cinderlander and hands the Shoanti killer’s vicious weapon, his repeating crossbow, to the Quah’s leaders as a sign of closure. Balian also adds an argument by reminding the council that the companions recently accepted Krojun’s tests and – even though they did not beat the Sklar-Quah champion in these challenges – they did prove themselves capable. The broad-shouldered warrior confirms this claim with a smile of respect on his face.
               </p>
               <p>
                When they have finished their plea, Valkur asks the companions to leave, so the council can deliberate what to do. He offers them the camp’s hospitality until the council comes up with an answer. Saamesh leads the companions out and takes them to one of the many campfires. There he is greeted heartily and the tribesmen around the fire immediately offer him and his guests a place by the fire and food. A sassy young girl with bright red hair and white paint around her eyes hugs Saamesh for a long time. When he introduces his rescuers to her, she is very grateful that they saved her brother. “My name is D’ari Firehair”, she says, as she turns to the fire and tears off a chunk of meat from the roast. She offers it to Balian: “Here, put some meat on those bones, you look like you enjoy a good piece of chow.” The ranger gratefully accepts and sinks his teeth into the savory flesh. “Seems like it has been a long time since you had yourself some fine meat. Don’t they like flesh in Korvosa?” she smiles, bowing forward and offering Balian a clear view into her cleavage. Then she reaches for the ranger’s shoulder, letting her hand glide to the hilt of his greatsword and pulling it out of its sheath. She weighs the heavy weapon, lets her eyes glide over the blade and then wields it in grand archers with apparent ease. Her final swing ends just under Balian’s chin. She pushes the tip against his skin: “Sklar-Quah women are as hot as fire, Korvosan, and as deadly as the rays of the sun.” With the gentlest of pushes she draws a single drop of blood from the ranger’s throat. Then she flicks the sword around and hands it back to its owner, hilt first. “Still, for my brother’s savior, I’m willing to make an exception”, she smiles. As Balian reaches for his greatsword, she pulls him closer and presses a fiery kiss on his lips. “Don’t ever say that D’ari Firehair knows no gratitude”, she teases, and gives the ranger a light slap in his behind. The other Shoanti laugh. Apparently this little show has served perfectly to break the ice.
               </p>
               <p>
                During the meal Saamesh expands on his time in Urgir and explains how the party saved him from certain death. By the time the meal is done, the Korvosan heroes feel right at home. None of the Shoanti around this fire show any hostility, on the contrary, they seem to welcome the strangers in their camaraderie. D’ari remains at Balian’s side and continues to tease him the whole time. When the final rays of the sun almost sink behind the horizon, the camp bursts out in commotion. Three dark shapes in the sky close in fast against the dying of the light. Each of the giant eagle-like birds carries a rider on its back. These are the mighty rocs of the Tammir-Quah, the Wind Clan. Some enthusiastic young boys cry out in rapture: “The rocs are coming, the rocs are coming!” D’ari explains that they are expecting at least four thousand warriors and healers. Everyone should be here in two weeks’ time. That is when the army will leave for Korvosa.

                A messenger arrives at the campfire, saying that the council has its answer. The party is guided back to the war-yurt, which is now almost empty, except for the leaders of the Quahs and Thousand Bones, who are still seated by the bonfire. Valkur has good news; the companions have convinced the council of their good intentions and are
                <i>
                 tshamek
                </i>
                no more, they are now
                <i>
                 nalharest
                </i>
                , brothers of the Shoanti who will be treated as friends for as long as they do not choose to oppose the tribes. The great chief goes on that he cannot reveal the Sklar-Quah’s biggest secret to the party, because even he does not know what it is. Only the mightiest shamans of his tribe share in this privilege. However, with all that is going on in Korvosa, the Shoanti have agreed to make an exception for the heroes and inform them. At that the Quahjothka points at the bonfire in the center of the war-yurt. “If you want to learn what is truly plaguing your city, you will have to step into the fire”, he states. Sjo is the first to step up. Staring in the flames he picks up the outlines of a humanoid shape, that beckons him closer. The healer does not hesitate and walks into the blazing fire, followed by his friends. The heat burns them hard, but then the pain resides and they feel only warmth.
               </p>
               <p>
                The burning figure appears before them: “My name is Arunan Lives-Of-Fire, Sun shaman of the Sklar-Quah. Your tales of the jothka-woman in the stone yurt-camp Korvosa confirm our suspicions that she has unearthed the ancient ‘evil’ from Mashka-saht-puyuhoke, the great mastaba, an evil that was interred there by my predecessors many generations ago. The knowledge of what lies hidden in the mastaba has been handed down over the ages, from one Sun shaman to the other. Now I will reveal the secret to ‘others’ for the first time in history, for the need is great and you offer one of the best chances to stop the threat.
               </p>
               <p>
                Hundreds of years ago, when my people still walked the lush meadows of the lowlands and lived on the shores of the great water, Sun shaman Coja Eyes-Aflame left his tribe to fight at the side of a legendary hero from the distant lands of Lastwall against a formidable ruler who was known for his unparalleled cruelty and thirst for conquest. When armies failed to halt his advance, the hero from Lastwall assembled a small and secret cabal of warriors, magic-users and mystics, Coja Eyes-Aflame among them. Using power and stealth the heroes infiltrated the tyrant’s stronghold. The atrocities they found there tested them to their limits, and when they reached the enemy’s throne room, a terrific battle took place. It was during this battle that they stripped away the tyrant’s human disguise, revealing a powerful blue dragon who had been empowered by the blessings of his dark god. Assuming his true form, the monster attacked the cabal, and a long and bloody battle ensued. His scales deflected most of their attacks and his claws and lightning breath made short work of many of their best and bravest warriors. In the end it was the hero from Lastwall himself who was able to slip through the dragon’s guard and deliver the fatal blow.
               </p>
               <p>
                Yet even in death, the tyrant’s body shuddered and grasped. Fire and acid destroyed much of the dragon’s corpse, yet seven fragments proved impossible to destroy. These grisly relics were so suffused with evil and malignancy that they refused to burn or melt – and even as the heroes watched, the bones twitched and writhed as they tried to return to life. The cabal’s leader ordered his surviving brothers and sisters to each take one of these seven relics out into the world and go into hiding. None would know where the other members went, least of all their leader, who would remain in the tyrant’s stronghold to guard it against ever being used for evil again.
               </p>
               <p>
                And so it is that my predecessor returned to his people, carrying the burden of the
                <i>
                 Fangs of Midnight
                </i>
                , the blue dragon’s teeth. Coja was a changed man, his hands shook and his eyes bore an ever-terrified gaze. At night he often screamed out in horror. He shared his story with his fellow shamans and together they opted to hide the
                <i>
                 Fangs
                </i>
                in the ancient Thassilonian monument on the shore of his people’s ancestral lands. They spent the rest of their lives guarding the monument, seeking to ensure that nothing dared enter the hidden chambers within, and when they died, they passed the task down to their successors. And so, for hundreds of years, the descendants of this now forgotten Shoanti mystic guarded and protected the
                <i>
                 Fangs of Midnight
                </i>
                from discovery, teaching their people that it was their sacred duty to stand watch over the mastaba. During these centuries the Sun shamans learned much about the power of the artifact. Part of the dragon’s soul endured and tried to force its will on those around it. But the Sun shamans were aurochheaded and well-trained, and their strong minds resisted the dragon’s temptations. As long as no one actually handled the teeth, they lacked the strength to truly dominate anyone and cause further harm. But now I fear that, for the first time since they were entombed in the holy site of Mashka-saht-puyuhoke, the
                <i>
                 Fangs of Midnight
                </i>
                have been touched by human hands, with unspeakable consequences.
               </p>
               <p>
                The fragment of the dragon’s soul is like a plant: it seeks to take root in fertile soil, where it can blossom and grow to become a potent tree. Hearing your stories, I believe that this has happened to the Jothka-woman who you call Ileosa-Queen. If I understand you correctly I’d even say that she is wearing the
                <i>
                 Fangs of Midnight
                </i>
                on her head. Her own cruelty and strength have been multiplied thousand fold by the evil artefact. On top of that the teeth will have given her supernatural powers. But the worst thing is that she now carries
                <b>
                 two souls
                </b>
                in herself, which gives her tremendous control over her own vulnerability and mortality.
               </p>
               <p>
                Knowledge of how Coja’s cabal defeated the dragon will be key to fighting her as well. But what my foregoers handed down to me is vague and fragmentary at best. I cannot give you the weapons to combat this evil, because I do not know them. Still, the fire of my predecessors burn within mel, just like it burned in the chest of Coja Eyes Aflame. Find his bones and rekindle his fire, then he will give you the insight you need to defeat his old nemesis.
               </p>
               <p>
                I am unsure of where the Sun shamans from the days of yore lie buried. The ancient shores have been lost to us for so long that I cannot even begin to imagine what they looked like. I do know that they were not entombed in Mashka-saht-puyuhoke out of fear that the unnatural tendrils of evil would disturb their voyage to the eternal hunting grounds. Lore says that they were laid to rest in burial mounds within sight of the great mastaba, so they could guard over it even in death. Coja Eyes Aflame’s bones must lie there as well, somewhere, but if I understand correctly, your people have filled the shores with stone yurts, so it will be hard to locate the Sun shaman’s remains. I also fear that I cannot guide you any more than I have done just now. Still, my inner flame tells me that Coja’s bones have passed the test of time. Finding them will be your task.”
               </p>
               <p>
                Then the burning shaman reaches into his own chest and pulls out a white glowing flame. He motions for Sjo to open his mouth and then places the ball of searing fire on his tongue. “Breath this flame into the glorious mystic’s remains and he will help you”, Arunan assures. “I’m sorry I cannot be of more help and that I cannot send the great spirits of my ancestors with you, they would only get lost in the maze that the mastaba shores have become. Only a spirit that knows the place as it exist today would be able to guide you.”
               </p>
               <p>
                Upon hearing this, Sjo pulls out the deck of Harrow cards and summons Zellara’s spirit. “Maybe she can help?” he offers. Arunan looks pleased as Zellara’s ghost appears. “I find myself in strange lands,” she says, “far from the streets and alleyways I call home. But I feel you are among allies. Though no bonds of friendship have formed yet, mutual respect hangs around your shoulders like a warm blanket. How can I be of help?”
               </p>
               <p>
                Sjo explains that they will need Zellera’s help in recovering the whereabouts of a buried Shoanti shaman, somewhere in the city of Korvosa. Arunan fills in as many details as he can. The Varisian fortune-teller is happy to oblige, but recommends patience: “The secrets of the Shoanti lie buried under three centuries of Korvosan history and hatred. Locating the remains of a long-gone mystic will be like finding a needle in a haystack. But I will do my best to help you, although I should warn you not to expect a speedy result. The search will be hard and might prove long. I can only hope that I can provide an answer in time. When we get back home, place my deck of cards on Korvosan soil, so I can begin my search.” The next moment Zellara’s spirit fades.
               </p>
               <p>
                Arunan looks positively surprised. “You are truly blessed by those who have left us. You walk with the spirits, who honor us still with their presence and friendship. Go now with the strength of the spirits and the friendship of the tribes.” After these words Arunan disappears as well, his burning body melting into the bonfire. The companions step from the flames and face Valkur and the council again. The big chief regards Sjo carefully, nodding his head in respect when he catches a fiery glimpse in the healer’s milky eyes. “Now the might of the Sklar-Quah is truly with you. I wish you a speedy journey back and good fortune at the end of your path. We will follow in two weeks, to pick up the fight if you fail. But if you succeed, you should contact us, so we can discuss our people’s future together.”
               </p>
               <p>
                Quint suggests they use magic to stay in touch during their mission. Thousand Bones will be happy to serve as a medium. Depending on the heroes’ progress or failure, the Shoanti might have to expedite or postpone their war movements. The companions certainly feel that now there is some room for flexibility on this front. The Quahs are placing a lot of trust in their hands, they hope they can live up to the challenges ahead.

               <p>
                Balian spends the night in the arms of D’ari Firehair, Saamesh’s sister, learning how hot Sklar-Quah women can actually be. The next morning the companions leave for Kaer Maga in horseback. They reach the cliff-top city by the afternoon, which gives them some time to sell off the loot they gathered over the last couple of days and invest in some scrolls and new equipment.

                scroll the companions magically travel to the gates of Janderhoff, the dwarven city. The guards recognize them and show them in, leading them to a beautiful manor house, where Neolandus Kalepopolis is now staying. The former seneschal is overjoyed to see the heroes again and offers them the hospitality of his dinner table. He is interested in every little detail of what has happened to them since they last met. Quint spins an enthralling tale, leaving out nothing. Kalepopolis delights at the party’s success, but the impending war with the Cinderland Shoanti causes him distress.
               </p>
               <p>
                Kalepopolis has news as well. Although the Gray Maidens in Korvosa have been thorough in their efforts to root out the Sable Company, twenty-eight of the marines have escaped persecution and have been granted sanctuary in the city of Janderhoff. Some of them are even staying in the very manor where the young friends are now. The situation in Korvosa has greatly deteriorated over the last couple of weeks. The queen has tightened her iron grip on the city. Her maidens are ever-present and enforce the law without any measure of leniency. Anyone who even dares to utter a word of doubt concerning the new government is suspected of rebellion and immediately arrested. Most arrests quickly end in execution, often without a proper trial. Cadavers of these so-called traitors hang all over the city as warning signs. The common man is scared out of his wits and hardly comes out of his house, fearing the cruelty of the Gray Maidens. The queen’s guard terrorizes everyone without discrimination, whether they be low-born or of noble blood. Apart from the merciless manhunt for surviving Sable Company marines, the Maidens invade every house to demand taxes, look for young girls to bolster their own ranks and – a consequence of the Janderhoff dwarves’ decision to cease trade with Korvosa – to confiscate any and all objects made of iron, to have them reforged into ever more gray maiden suits of armor. The churches of Asmodeus and Abadar have openly proclaimed their support for the queen, while the temples of Sarenrae and Pharasma remain neutral. Vencarlo Orisini has returned to the city and stays in contact with Kalepopolis via carrier pigeons, sending him short messages in code. These updates are sparse and concise. Apparently Vencarlo has joined some kind of rebellion movement, but cannot provide details out of fear that his notes might fall into the wrong hands.

                The next morning the companions are summoned to the palace of clan lord Ragnar Ironfist. Quint explains that an ancient evil has taken hold of queen Ileosa, and that he and his friends will try to fight this malevolence before the Shoanti come down from the Storval Heights to invade the Korvosan lowlands. He also reveals that his party has been to the great city of Koldukar, or rather Urgir as it is known now. Ironfist is excited to hear about the formidable dwarven sky citadel, but cannot hide his sadness at learning about the place’s decline. The dwarven lord offers his guests the chance to stock up once more in the temple of Torag, leaving them in the capable hands of its high priest, Bardin Bronzebeard. The companions buy some scrolls of

Zellara claims that it is getting ever harder for her to manifest in the city. It is as if a dark veil hangs over the city, clouding and smothering her mind. She offers to read the cards again for the companions before starting her search for the remains of sun shaman Coja Eyes-Aflame. This time the reading is centered around the star cards. During the
                <i>
                 choosing
                </i>
                , Balian’s hand falls upon the Winged Serpent, who cautions him to use more tact. The queen-mother tells Puk to aid the helpless and hopeless, while the carnival card warns Quint to plan ahead. The owl ushers Sjo to combat the unnatural state of things that has taken hold of the city.

                tells Balian to be careful of sinister and dark pacts that he will come across. Puk is told that he has been making the right decisions so far, though he is warned not to doubt too much and just act. The empty throne in Sjo’s cards is a hint that fighting the ‘powers that be’ should not lead to a vacuum at the top, but the courtesan clearly tells him that masks will have to fall. Finally Quint is shown that what once seemed beautiful, might be rotten at its core. The peacock teaches him that he should do well to stand aside when this thing of apparent beauty passes by, lest he be petrified by it.

               <p>
                After the Harrow reading, Zellara opens her mind to try and find a mental trace of the sun shaman. She spreads her arms and closes her eyes to expand her mind. Although spirits do not breath, she starts gasping and shaking uncontrollably. When she opens her eyes again, they have turned white. “Oh, no!” she heaves, “they have found me!” The next moment the Varisian spirit is sucked into the deck of cards, which falls lifeless on the floor. Using
                <i>
                 detect magic
                </i>
                Sjo notices that the cards do not radiate magic anymore. When he picks up the deck, he doesn’t even feel a trace of the Varisian spirit. It seems as if she has disappeared completely. This turn of events is a huge set-back for the party, since Zellara was to be their guide to Coja Eyes-Aflame. How will they find his remains now?
               </p>
               <p>
                Sjo is eager to see how his fiancé is doing and heads to the shrine of Shelyn. Walking up to Five Corners in North Point the party gets to experience the ominous atmosphere of Korvosa’s streets for themselves. Very few people are out and about, and those who are, hurry along with their heads hanging low. A patrol of Gray Maidens is making ‘house calls’ forcing their ways into people’s homes to collect taxes and confiscate iron goods. Since the queen’s guards have drafted so many new members lately, one would expect at least some of these female soldiers to look inexperienced, but Balian feels they all seem more than comfortable in their full plate armor. Perhaps the new recruits are still in training somewhere, leaving their more seasoned colleagues to patrol the city.
               </p>
               <p>
                Larella is very happy to see her future husband alive. She can update him and his friends on the current situation in Korvosa. Fortunately the plague has been cured, even in Old Korvosa. The quarantine of the island has been lifted as a result, but that does not mean that things are going well in Korvosa’s oldest district. Big parts of Endrin Island have always housed some of the city’s poorest inhabitants, and the recent plague and quarantine have worsened their plight considerably. Moreover, current circumstances of fear and oppression offer little hope of improvement.
               </p>
               <p>
                Balian wonders about the state of the noble families. Larella says that the Arkona’s have been even more withdrawn from society lately than the normally are. After commander Marcus Endrin’s failed attempt on the queen’s life, his family has been outlawed. His wife was executed. Larella has no idea what became of his three children. House Bromathan has paid dearly for its support to Endrin and the Sable Company. Lord Valdur IV rots away in the city’s dungeons, while his wife Lady Merisse and son Valdur V have been placed under house arrest. His daughters were both drafted for the queen’s forces. Like all recruits they have not been heard of since. Jeggare is still in place, but being one of the richest families in the city, they’ve had to pay huge amounts of taxes to the treasury. Members of House Leroung have also lost the queen’s favor. They showed quite a lot of criticism for the new government in the latest issue of the Korvosa Herald and have been placed under house arrest as well. Their university has been closed until further notice. Sjo wonders if they would still be able to consult the school’s extensive library, hoping he might come across more information that might lead to the discovery of the Sun Shaman’s grave.
               </p>
               <p>
                House Zenderholm is still around, but Larella suspects that the extremely lawful nature of its head, Hanging Judge Zenobia Zenderholm, will not mesh well with the queen’s policy of playing judge and jury at the same time. House Ornelos is the only family openly supporting queen Ileosa. As a result none of the Ornelos girls have been forced to join the Gray Maiden army.
               </p>
               <p>
                Explaining to the priestess of Shelyn how an ancient evil from the bowels of the mastaba under Castle Korvosa has taken control of the queen, it suddenly dawns on Quint that the ‘Teeth of Midnight’ might also have been the mysterious ‘muse’ that inspired several Korvosan artists in the past. These open, creative minds would probably have been quite susceptible to the dragon’s feeble influence, which would explain why the Korvosan art scene has always been so morbidly and sinisterly inspired. When queen Ileosa discovered the evil artefact, it must have shifted focus to her completely, suddenly leaving the artists without a muse. Quint fears that Ileosa might be beyond saving: if the ‘abandoned’ artists already felt so desperate that they took their own lives, how could the queen ever survive a hundredfold stronger hold on her mind being broken? This new insight does not bode well for Ileosa, leaving her virtually no chance of a future.

                The companions consider what to do. Should they dive into the library and look for more information on Shoanti graves? Is there a way they can bring Zellara back? Should they try and contact the resistance? Are the many young girls who are being recruited for the Maidens in need of rescue? And what should they use for an excuse if they need a good cover story? Mixing truth with fiction, they decide upon a tale that they have to return the ancient bones of a mythic shaman to the Shoanti to keep them from invading Korvosa with a huge army.
               </p>
               <p>
                Maybe it is best to start with something easy first: suspecting that Vencarlo is hiding in Old Korvosa, the party heads for the island in the north of the city. When they cross Jeggare Circle, they happen upon the construction of a gigantic statue of the queen from black stones. The laborers seem little motivated, as do the members of the Korvosan Guard who have been tasked to watch over the site. The stone reaches twenty feet already, and it looks like it only goes up to Ileosa’s knees so far.
               </p>
               <p>
                The only bridge over the Narrows of Saint Alika has a guard detail of Gray Maidens and all who want to cross are given a thorough inspection. The party goes west, wanting to get over the water at the westernmost point of the Narrows with the
                <i>
                 Dimension Door
                </i>
                from Puk’s cloak. When they get there, they find out where the big black stones for Ileosa’s statue come from: the Great Tower is being torn down. A magic jump brings the companions to the other side of the water, to some of the poorest quarters of Old Korvosa. The upside of this poverty-stricken neighborhood is that it is almost free of Gray Maidens, making it easy for the party to get to House Arkona.
               </p>
               <p>
                Glorio Arkona welcomes the heroes with open arms, once again offering to aid them in their quest to fight the evil in Castle Korvosa and inviting them to stay in his house, since their villa has been compromised. Sjo thanks him for his kindness, but says they have their own place to lay low. Lord Arkona denies being involved with the resistance, claiming the rebels are hiding somewhere in the south of the city. He hasn’t seen Vencarlo since he left the city and didn’t even know the fencing master had returned. When Quint tells him about the Red Mantis attacks, Glorio is worried. The assassins are not known for giving up, once the mantis are on your tail, they do not relent. The heroes confront Glorio with their own dilemma: they need to recover the bones of an old Shoanti shaman who was buried somewhere in the city long ago. What would be the best way to find his grave: magic or research in the library? Lord Arkona is not sure, but reckons that magic would definitely be easier. Still, Quint cannot think of an effective spell that would lead him to his goal in due time.
               </p>
               <p>
                Finally the companions decide to check out the library. Quint tries to come up with a plan to infiltrate the occupied building, perhaps in the guise of some official who is on a royal mission. That might suffice to fool the Gray Maidens. The best course of action would be to stake out the place first. When darkness has fallen, Lord Arkona has the party taken back to the mainland in a small boat, but not after hosting an exotic dinner party and extending a helping hand once more for the future. By the light of the moon the party walks past the Acadamae; nothing can be seen beyond its great walls, except for the imps who flutter in the air above.

                House Leroung is situated in the heart of Korvosa, on the university grounds.

                . Since the nobles are under house arrest, they might have ample time to do research for the companions, so Balian wonders if they would be able to contact one of them and enlist their aid, like Aisha, the star from

                Puk circles the building, picking up noise and laughter from the corner room. Balian activates his

                boots and peeks inside, but the room is unlit, so the ranger cannot see a thing. Sjo remembers that Sirtane Leroung’s laboratory led out into a small patio area. This might be the perfect way inside. Balian flies everyone over and Puk tries to pick the lock, but finds it too hard to open. Quint pulls out the Key-Lock Killer’s bell and manages to get the way in unlocked.
                <a href="http://mrvergee.deviantart.com/art/Sneaking-into-House-Leroung-607544485?q=gallery%3AMrVergee&amp;qo=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">

Quint wonders whether they should look through the books themselves rather than bother the family, but the party’s conversation alerts the two Gray Maidens who are guarding the public entrance. Apparently our friends forgot that you always have to keep quiet in the library.

His deception works and the guards lead the party to the other side of the building, where the Leroungs live. Unfortunately there are even more Gray Maidens in this part of the house, who do not succumb to Quint's mind games. They draw steel, threatening to drown the room, a private shrine to Irori, in blood.

                The new Gray Maidens in the shrine to Irori do not only prove highly resistant to Quint’s mind-affecting tricks, they also possess superior fighting skills. One of them challenges Balian and hits him extra hard, while her colleague makes her sword burn with black flames which bite at the ranger. Moreover, the two women fight in perfect unison, putting up a shield wall when the get attacked. Balian also finds that his special sense to fight ‘humans’ does not kick in when he faces these guards; his new sword’s holy damage on the other hand flares up when his swings connect. With Spyder blocking off the third of these special maidens, Sjo and Quint are left with the two guards they encountered initially. These girls are definitely of a different kind than the three new Maidens, more within the limits of what you’d expect a Gray Maiden to be: human soldiers who possess some skill at battle, but who are by no means superwomen. This gives our friends the chance to cast some spells first: Sjo mumbles a

                 prayer
                </i>
                , while Quint enhances the party with
                <i>
                 haste
                </i>
                and starts up a

                </i>
                performance to debuff the enemy. Puk tumbles behind one of the super maidens, but sees his first stab deflected by her neighbor’s shield. When he manages to get a cut in, he also finds that his tiny blades are partially resisted. Balian exchanges more blows with the supermaidens and is happy to learn that Sjo’s magic of
                <i>
                 shield other
                </i>
                gives him much more staying power. He delivers a tremendous critical blow to the maiden on his left, just as Puk’s many vicious slices take down the woman on his right. When the halfling delivers the final blow, the creature inside the elegant full plate splashes out in one huge burst of blood. The various pieces of her armor drop on the floor, soaked in red fluid … but no body remains.
               </p>
               <p>
                This brings back memories. The party recalls Dame Nesia, the naked girl they found in the streets, who had lost any and all recollection of who she was or where she came from. As it turned out, the girl was some kind of blood simulacrum or blood clone. Balian suspects that these women are the same, albeit of a perfected nature. Sjo, who is badly hurt from taking half of Balian’s damage, heals himself as Quint tries out his new rapier’s powers on one of the ordinary maidens. The weapon’s
                <i>
                 inspire
                </i>
                ability allows him to use his bardic performance to enhance his swings with his charisma rather than his strength, making the bard a more formidable fighter in melee. Just when the companions seem to be getting the upper hand, the door ahead swings open and three more maidens join the fray, two of which fight like twins again. The third acts as somewhat of a tactician: she can guide her fellow soldiers in battle. Sjo recognizes a good opportunity when he sees one: the new and old opponents are all on the far side of the room, with only Puk in their midst. A perfect chance for a fireball! The explosion tears through the enemy, while the little halfling rogue manages to evade all the flames, laughing as another clone bursts out in a splash of blood.

                 His joy is quickly suppressed, however, when a red skinned devil appears behind the fresh forces, in the next hall, with Lady Eliasia Leroung in his clutches.
                </a>
                “There they are, milady, your rebel friend! I knew they would show up! I knew it”, the creature cackles, just before slicing his knife across Lady Leroung’s throat. Her dead body drops to the floor. Quint is furious and shouts out threats to the murderer: “You filthy leprechaun, you’re gonna wish you’d never left Hell!”
               </p>
               <p>
                In the meantime Puk and Balian take out another blood clone, Sjo continues healing and Quint cuts down one of the ‘normal’ Maidens. The devil zaps behind Sjo, but cannot do much damage before falling to Quint’s wild attacks. The bard even makes sure the creature is truly defeated, by stabbing the corpse through the neck once more. Balian and Puk’s efficiency takes care of the rest: two more blood clones and two human Gray Maidens bite the dust. One of these real maidens is still bleeding and Sjo makes sure she survives by stabilizing her. The victory does not grant joy, however, since Lady Eliasia lies truly dead and her children now run down the stairs to mourn her loss. Christina Leroung, her eldest daughter, is enraged at the companions. She lashes out at Quint for invading her home and getting her mother killed. When Balian mutters something about a possible resurrection she starts hitting him. This was an assassin devil, its victims cannot be brought back! She is also desperate about her family’s future. Where should they go now? They will certainly be punished for this! The noblewoman keeps slapping Balian frantically, until he grabs her in a big bear hug to calm her down. Her sisters, Siri and Aisha (the opera star) and her aunt Sirtane (the alchemy professor) kneel down by Eliasia’s body. Aisha and Siri are crying with great despair over their dead mother, while Sirtane does her best to whisper words of comfort. Cyril Fordyce, Eliasia’s husband, the history professor and editor of the Herald, is staring with blind apathy.

               <p>
                Quint whisper some apologies, but Sirtane take shim to the next room to talk to him, as she is the only one who is in control of her emotions at the moment. Quint explains why they were here, they need to locate an ancient Shoanti grave somewhere under Korvosa. The tomb holds the corpse of a shaman who fought the evil that has now taken hold of Queen Ileosa. If they want to face her, they will need the shaman’s aid. They were hoping to find clues in the library as to where the tomb might be situated. Sirtane understands and takes Quint to the ‘history’ room in the library, selecting a good number of books that the bard tucks away in his

               <p>
                The companions decide to hide the Leroung family in the abandoned fishery that used to be to Gaedran Lamm’s hideout. It is nearby and safe. They travel there under the cloak of invisibility, taking the corpse of Lady Eliasia with them. Afterwards they return to the Leroung residence to interrogate the surviving Gray Maiden. She seems to be one of the soldiers who came from Cheliax a few months ago. She sees no evil in working with devils, as these creatures are summoned to serve, not to command. When Quint gets mad at her for being blind to her malevolent acts, she returns the argument by calling him a rebel who refuses to accept the rightful ruler and as such being the cause of all this unpleasantness. Quint’s anger gets the best of him: he draws his rapier and runs the woman through. His hope for finding redeemable Gray Maidens diminishes again, although he realizes that there must still be several women in their numbers who started out as good, normal Korvosans and who might only be misguided. Still, the uniforms and masks make it almost impossible to distinguish  between the soldiers. How will he be able to tell who can still be saved and who deserves to die?

                The companions spend the night with the distraught Leroung family in the old fishery. The next morning they deliberate with the nobles on how to proceed. It is clear that the government will hunt down the Leroungs, so they’ll need a place to hide. Getting them out of the city to a safe haven like Magnimar would take too much precious time, so while that option would probably be best, it is not viable at the moment. Quint suggests taking them to Glorio Arkona, but Christine Leroung does not trust the man in the least and blocks off that idea. The best alternative seems to be the rebellion. If they can locate the rebel hideout, the Leroungs could take shelter there. Christine Leroung is still fuming at the young heroes for getting her mother killed and walks out of the meeting. Only Sirtane Leroung, the late lady Eliasia’s sister, retains enough clarity to talk to the party. Quint leaves the books they took from the library with her and makes for the city to try and find out where the rebels are hiding. He takes Balian with him for added security. Sjo remains in the fishery to guard the Leroung family and Puk returns to the library to see if their nightly exploits have been discovered yet. It turns out they have: numerous Gray Maidens are walking in and out of the building, obviously upset by the murder of so many of their sisters. The atmosphere crackles with nervous energy and anger.
               </p>
               <p>
                Quint and Balian scout the harbor, only to come across a town crier, who announces a big parade to be held in the streets - including the palace square - around noon. He invites all citizens to attend. This parade will apparently take off in the harbor, where an enormous festive wagon is being prepared. The front of this float holds a podium and the back sports an impressive loading area with some kind of dragon-headed crane. Our friends notice the heavy-bodied new seneschal of Korvosa, the Acadamae master of Transmutation, Togomor, floating above the deck of a ship. He uses his magic to lift a humongous box out of the hold and attaches it to the dragon crane on the wagon. It is unclear what the box contains exactly, but it most certainly holds some kind of ferocious animal that growls and struggles inside the iron walls. Next a half-orc with a vicious whip leads out six large white-furred and four-armed gorillas and harnesses them up one by one to pull the vehicle. By noon a group of entertainers arrives, most of whom Quint knows as rather mediocre artists. They will form the music band that will lead the march through the city. Next several warrior-like types get off the boat: a fierce-looking ettin and ogre, a broad-shouldered human carrying two blades at his belt who moves with a grace that belies his muscular build. There are also a tall and proud Shoanti barbarian, two bugbears in armor who look like twins and an orc with a heavy halberd.

                 When the parade finally gets moving, a fair number of people have come out of their houses to watch.
                </a>
                Young boys runs about handing out flyers, announcing the reopening of the old Kendall Arena. Queen Ileosa offers her subjects the wonderful opportunity to see the greatest gladiators in Golarion fight monstrous beasts and even each other to the death. Chief among these champions of the arena is the mighty Maxor from Cheliax, the handsome human with the two blades.
               </p>
               <p>
                Balian and Quint follow the parade all the way to the palace. Along the way they hook up with Puk, who has come down to see the show as well. A mild feeling of wonder and enthusiasm has taken hold of the crowd, which increases when the parade reaches the palace, where the troupe halts to greet the queen. Ileosa is standing on the palace terrace overlooking the spectacle. The band burst out in a song that turns out to be the new Korvosan hymn, honoring the city and its queen. Quint takes mental notes on the composition, so he can replay it if a future occasion calls for it. When the anthem is over, the crowd cheers wildly. Ileosa’s charm offensive seems to be working, though her display of power still has to reach its climax. From behind the castle loud screeches ring out as one, then two and finally three mighty dragons rise up.
                <a href="http://mrvergee.deviantart.com/art/Ileosa-mother-of-dragons-613162775?ga_submit_new=10%253A1465042665" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
                 The crowd falls silent when it sees the awe-inspiring red, blue and black winged serpents land next to the queen.
                </a>
                Then the buzz takes up again, leading to an overwhelming applause and cries of ‘the mother of dragons’.
               </p>
               <p>
                Ileosa takes in the reverence for a few moments, waves once more and then takes her leave, joined by the three scaly cbehemoths. Her majesty definitely has a flare for the dramatic, giving the people just enough to be dumb-struck before disappearing. The parade gets moving again, continuing down Ramp Boulevard to Kendall Plaza. Puk follows to see how the wagon sinks into the catacombs below the arena. Meanwhile Quint and Balian head to the market to grab a bite and feel the pulse of the city after Ileosa’s latest stunt. Quint fires up a discussion about the rebellion and quickly finds out that the citizens stand divided. Some long for a return to law and order, and they are convinced Ileosa can provide this. Others claim that this so-called order comes at too high a price: daughters are being torn from their families and taxes bleed everyone dry. Balian immediately agrees, taking part in the conversation like never before. The ranger is such a heartfelt tax-hater that he cannot keep quiet. Quint suspects some people of sympathy for the rebellion, but he does not get the feeling there are actual rebels among them. The two companions spend the rest of the afternoon gathering more information. While it becomes clear that the rebels must indeed have a secret hideout somewhere, no one seems to know where: rumors seem to point to every corner of the city.
               </p>
               <p>
                Late in the afternoon the two friends return to the fishery. Across from the building is a small bakery: a couple women walk out just as the heroes arrive. From a nearby ally a group of thugs appears and assaults the unwary customers. They pull the fresh loaves from the women’s hands and grab at their skirts. “This is bread for the rebellion!” they shout. “Or don’t you support the freedom fighters? Fans of that wh*re on the throne, are you? What do you say, guys, shall we teach these little sluts a lesson?”
               </p>
               <p>
                Before Quint and Balian can react, a shadow appears on the roof above the scene. His cape flutters in the wind. He’s wearing Blackjack’s outfit! “Well, well, buffoons! How about leaving these good citizens alone? Is this the great cause you are fighting for? Robbing and harassing people in the streets? Why don’t you try and take on someone your own size?” At that the caped man leaps down to the street, landing lightly on his feet. He whips out his rapier and swirls through the thugs with gusto. Quint studies the savior’s movements and immediately determines it is not Vencarlo. Although the rapier-wielding hero moves with incredible grace and speed, his style definitely differs from Vencarlo’s. Not only that, Quint seriously doubt the man is a human altogether. Despite his obvious prevalence in battle, the caped savior does not really hurt any of the thugs. He knocks the daggers from their hands and hits them with the pommel of his sword or beats and kicks them with his free hand and feet. Before long the thugs slinks back into the ally, leaving ‘Blackjack’ laughing in the street. Balian can’t help but feel that this combat was completely staged. He runs into the ally after the fleeing bandits. Puk, who heard the fight from the old fishery, joins him. From around the corner they hear the hooligans talking amongst each other. “Damn, that Blackjack dude hits harder every time, that’s not what we signed on for.”
               </p>
               <p>
                In the main street Quint walks up to the ‘caped crusader’, who is just helping the robbed women to their feet and hands them some money to replace their lost bread: “Blackjack, what an honor to finally meet you! I have always been a fan!” Quint greets.
               </p>
               <p>
                “Thanks, I do what I can to restore order and squash these rabble-rousers in the bud!” Blackjack replies. His accent betrays that he is not native to Korvosa.
               </p>
               <p>
                “You did very well indeed,” Quint continues, “but didn’t you fight against her majesty until recently? I remember you saving that girl from being executed by Ileosa just a few months ago!”
               </p>
               <p>
                “A man is allowed to change his mind when he realizes he was wrong”, Blackjack states. “I’d give you some coin as well, my friend, but you don’t look like you need it, not like these good people.” At that Blackjack whips out a piece of rope to a support beam along the edge of the roof and climbs up the wall of the bakery. “I’ve got more citizens to save from these stupid rebels!” he cheers as he disappears from view.
               </p>
               <p>
                In the ally Balian and Puk are still eavesdropping on the thugs – who were clearly pretending to be rebels - when suddenly, they hear someone whistle ever so gently behind them. Sitting in the shadows of a chimney on one of the lower houses in the street is a figure that beckons them closer. Balian activates his
                <i>
                 boots of flying
                </i>
                and Puk quickly scales to wall with his
                <i>
                 slippers of spider climbing
                </i>
                . It is Vencarlo Orisini, the former fighter to breathe life into the Blackjack persona: “Is there anywhere we can talk in private?” he asks.
               </p>
               <p>
                The company retreats to the old fishery and expresses its joy at seeing Vencarlo again. The sword master is equally pleased at seeing his friends safe. He confirms that a false Blackjack is running loose in the city. He’s been trying to follow the imposter, but the man seems to appear and disappear out of thin air. He always uses the same thugs to assault innocent citizens in an  attempt to tarnish the rebels’ reputation and promote the queen’s order. Quint gives Vencarlo a full run-down of their latest adventures and discoveries, explaining how Ileosa’s crown is made from an ancient evil artifact. To fight her, the companions need the know-how and help of a long-forgotten Shoanti sun shaman, or at least, they need to find his bones, preferable before the Shoanti army arrives from the Cinderlands. Quint also tells Vencarlo that the party infiltrated the Leroung library, hoping to find books on old Shoanti burial sites. Things did not go as planned, however, and the heroes were forced to fight some Gray Maidens, most of whom turned out to be very accomplished blood clones.
               </p>
               <p>
                If the ‘good guys’ want to succeed at stopping Ileosa, they’ll have the best chance of success when they simply cut off the serpent’s head, but seeing how well the queen has surrounded herself with powerful allies, and knowing how much she’s strengthened her mental powers as well, won’t make that an easy task. Vencarlo proposes to go to the rebels’ secret base first. Illrem Bromathan, brother to the imprisoned Lord Valdur IV and normally next in line to become the Sable Company’s commander, leads the underground resistance. He will be happy to see mighty allies like the companions join the good cause.

                Vencarlo talks to the distraught Leroung family and convinces them to join the heroes to the rebel base. They place Lady Eliasia’s body on a hand drawn cart and make their way to the graveyard in the Gray District as a funeral procession. Puk scouts ahead and Vencarlo follows behind; both of them are on the look-out for possible sources of trouble, ready to interfere when necessary. Still, since the streets are a lot more crowded today than they have been in weeks, it is rather easy to get south undisturbed. The Leroung family take their dead mother to bishop Keppira d’Bear, to make arrangements for her burial. In the meantime Vencarlo leads the party to the rebel hideout, underneath a crypt in the graveyard. He tells them the church of Pharasma is in on the conspiracy, supporting the rebels as best they can without compromising their own safety.
               </p>
               <p>
                <a href="http://mrvergee.deviantart.com/art/Rebel-base-in-Korvosa-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-614606623?ga_submit_new=10%253A1465629182" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
                 The hideout is cramped with people who have fled prosecution, a fair number of young girls who were drafted for the Gray Maiden forces among them.
                </a>
                Vencarlo introduces the party members to Illrem Bromathan, the leader of the resistance, a former Sable Company officer. Illrem is brother to Lord Valdur IV, who has been arrested for being allied to House Endrin and being a staunch supporter of the Sable Company. No one has heard of him since his arrest, and Illrem can only hope that Valdur’s position as a priest of Sarenrae has kept him alive so far. Valdur’s wife and son have been placed under house arrest and are still residing in the family home under Gray Maiden guard, much like the Leroung family was. Illrem’s second-in-command is a young man whom the companions already know: Aaron Endrin, the son of the former commander of the Sable Company, Marcus Endrin, who was killed at the hands of the Queen herself. Sjo tells the rebels about the blood clone Maidens, which gets Illrem quite worried. The girls who have been recruited have all been brought to the temple of Asmodeus. Quint remembers from their earlier meeting with Archbishop Ornher Reebs of Asmodeus that the high priest seemed to know more about the cloning process, when they took Dame Nesia to the temple. The party and their rebel friends now fear that the recruits are being sacrificed in the temple to create the blood clone army. If this is the case, they will have to put an end to this vile practice as soon as possible.
               </p>
               <p>
                Balian questions this approach, though. He wonders if it is worth it exposing themselves, when most recruits are probably dead already. This practice must have been going on for weeks already. How many girls can be left to save? Quint argues that getting revenge for such an enormous evil in itself is worth it, even if there is no one left to save. Balian agrees, but asks for ‘carte blanche’ when they invade the temple to kill anyone he wants. He fears that capturing someone like Reebs is dangerous, only killing him will prevent him from escaping. Although Quint feels it is very likely that Reebs will lose his life in the raid, he finds it wise to try and question enemies first. If Reebs is one of Ileosa’s most powerful allies, he could be a valuable source of information. ‘Kill first, ask questions later’ does not work, so the bard suggests to ask the questions first. Killing the man afterwards is a very viable option!
               </p>
               <p>
                Suddenly Sjo looks like he’s slipping into a mini-trance. He hears Thousand Bones’ voice in his head. The Shoanti shaman tells him preparations in the Cinderlands are still on schedule and asks if they should proceed according to the agreed-upon timing. Sjo answers that there is no trace of the ancient shaman’s grave yet and that things are chaotic, but the timing is still okay.
               </p>
               <p>
                After Thousand Bones’
                <i>
                 sending
                </i>
                , the companions decide to stake out the temple of Asmodeus. They head to the other side of the city during the evening hours. There are six Gray Maidens in front of the temple doors. Their military stance and synchronous movements suggest they are blood clones. In the next half hour, no one enters the temple, but seven Gray Maidens come out and head into the city. Quint wants to try and get inside, preferably under cover. The Old Courthouse, where the companions spent one night of horror a couple of months ago, is the only safe place nearby he can think of to change into a disguise. Quint finds an old barrister’s robe in the building, cleans it up with
                <i>
                 prestidigitation
                </i>
                and puts it on over his clothes. He also puts on make-up to change his appearance. Now he looks like a lawyer, a perfect disguise to gain entry to the temple of the god of contracts. Quint approaches the Gray Maidens at the gate and convinces them to let him through.
               </p>
               <p>
                <a href="http://mrvergee.deviantart.com/art/Temple-of-Asmodeus-in-Korvosa-614608557?ga_submit_new=10%253A1465629979" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
                 The temple itself looks empty inside.
                </a>
                Quint sits down on one of the pews and starts praying. A few minutes later a woman exits from the side chapel and walks up to the late guest. She questions him about his identity. The bard claims to be a lawyer who has recently arrived from Cheliax. He is looking for clients and wouldn’t mind defending people who are not goody two-shoes … after all, everybody has the right to a good defense. You’d be amazed at what the law allows, even in bureaucratic places like Cheliax and Korvosa. The priestess smiles, but she strongly recommends that he read up on the many Korvosan laws and charters, for they are ‘many’ indeed! When Quint asks about the guards at the door, the priestess explains that things in the city have been quite hectic of late. The church of Asmodeus has openly joined the queen’s side and is possibly in danger from the queen’s enemies now, so they have been granted a number of royal guards.
               </p>
               <p>
                When Quint enquires about the church’s leader, Ornher Reebs, he notices some malcontent in the woman’s eyes. She tell him the archbishop is not available at the moment. Quint presses the matter and tries to find out more about the high priest, especially from the priestess’s perspective. The woman, whose name is Tyresha, does admit that she might see herself following in Reeb’s footsteps one day, but for now the man has things tightly under control in the temple. Quint suggests that there are other ways to help fate along, but Tyresha shies away from the idea of killing her leader. “It is not killing I refer to,” Quint quickly clarifies, “but using the law.” He links back to one of Reebs’ earliest deeds here in the city: the sacrifice of thirteen virgins. True, Asmodeus does consent with the occasional sacrifice, but he also has the sense to follow the laws of the land first. Such a sacrifice is indeed possible in Cheliax, but not in Korvosa. The city’s reaction to his imprudent offer almost got Asmodeus kicked out when he had just managed to get his foot in the door. If it hadn’t been for Queen Domina’s interference and the resurrection of most of the girls at her expense, Asmodeus would have been ousted from here before his temple was completed.
               </p>
               <p>
                “I just hope Reebs isn’t repeating the same stupidity before Korvosa –and especially its laws – are ready for it”, Quint goes on. Again he detects a hint of doubt in the priestess’s eyes. “In the eyes of the father church, such deeds would be considered ‘wrong’, not necessarily for being against church policy as such, but for discrediting the name of Asmodeus in a place where his worship is – let’s be honest – barely allowed. If this leads to the church being abolished from these lands, Asmodeus loses. And our Lord does not like to lose. Those responsible would have to be brought to church justice, which is actually the real reason why I am here.”
               </p>
               <p>
                “You are an inquisitor, then?” Tyresha gasps.
               </p>
               <p>
                “Indeed, I am”, Quint bluffs, seeing that the priestess totally buys his bluff.
               </p>
               <p>
                “Well, suppose I could give you information about the archbishop, could you make sure it serves my purposes as well?” she asks.
               </p>
               <p>
                “I do not have the power to name a new archbishop, but I would make sure that the father church knows about your loyalty. As you know, the Prince of contracts is a big fan of loyalty, I have no doubt it … you would be rewarded”, Quint tells her. “If the wrong-doings of the past were to repeat themselves, it would not bode well for Reebs, I can assure you.”
               </p>
               <p>
                “I suggest we move to the chapel”, Tyresha whispers. “It has been protected from eaves-dropping, if we want to negotiate contracts with potential ‘clients’, you see. It will be safer to talk there.”
               </p>
               <p>
                The priestess leads Quint to the side chapel to continue the conversation: “So, to make sure I understand you correctly, if I could confirm ill tidings about Reebs, you could help me rise to power in Korosa’s temple?”
               </p>
               <p>
                “I will definitely use all my influence in the church to see that happen”, Quint confirms.
               </p>
               <p>
                Tyresha smiles. “Well then, there is much I can tell you. The archbishop has been executing very extreme rituals in the basement, even for Asmodean standards. He’s been sacrificing numerous young girls, bleeding them completely dry to use their life’s blood to create an army of clones. He infuses these creatures further with devil blood and uses a special construct, called an ‘akaruzug’, to draw upon the talents of an accomplished ‘original’ and turn his creations into very skillful fighters.
               </p>
               <p>
                He has four Erinyes and one hamatula - or barbed devil - aiding him in this process. These servants have not been provided by Reebs himself, though, but rather by the queen, who has secured the servitude of a fair number of devils through an infernal contract. Judging by the number and strength of these devils alone, this contract must be one of the most powerful ones I have ever heard about. And her majesty did not sign it here, either, but at the Acadamae. Our school of wizards is known for its intimate dealings with devils, as I’m sure you know.”
               </p>
               <p>
                “You wouldn’t happen to have seen a copy of said contract?” Quint wonders.
               </p>
               <p>
                “The queen would be stupid to show this precious document to anyone. She probably keeps her copy hidden away in the castle, in a place no one can get to. The other copy is, obviously, still in the hands of the contract devil who made the agreement. I can’t even guess who he is, though someone in the Acadamae must know.”
               </p>
               <p>
                “Naturally”, Quint nods.
               </p>
               <p>
                “We all know Asmodeus works in mysterious ways. His contract dealers might indeed sign papers that allow an individual to control devils and command them to act in whichever way he or she desires, even if this would not be Asmodeus’s chosen path. On the other hand, in such cases Asmodeus would support efforts to see the contract fail its owner. After all, isn’t that why he likes to include loopholes in his contracts? Fooling mortals into thinking they gain great power, only to have the contract bite them in the ass and reap their souls prematurely?”
               </p>
               <p>
                “You understand our Lord’s teachings well. You would make a great successor for Reebs, indeed”, Quint acknowledges. “You will understand that I did not come to this city alone. I have a number of bodyguards waiting outside. I’m afraid I will have to return to bring Reebs’s wrong-doing to justice. Is there any way you can facilitate our entry?”
               </p>
               <p>
                “Of course there is, master inquisitor. I will leave the front doors unlocked and I will tell the guards at the door to let you through. You will find Ornher Reebs in the basement. I suspect he will be there all night”
               </p>
               <p>
                “Excellent, you should make sure you are nowhere about when we come in. It would be best if your role in this mess remains unnoticed. It is enough that I know of your loyalty so I can relay it to our leaders in Cheliax when the time is right”, Quint finishes.
               </p>
               <p>
                Confident she has struck a great deal, Tyresha shows the disguised bard out and informs the guards at the door that they should let the inquisitor in whenever he wants. After that Quint disappears into the night and reunites with his friends afew moments later. He feels quite happy to prove Balian wrong: words often are more powerful than the blade! Now at least the companions can prepare for the challenges ahead.

                It was truly a great achievement in roleplay. How Quint solely entered the lion's cage, used the priestess' ambitions against her, implied things never spoken aloud and quoted the dogmas of the church as if the 'inquisitor' was there himself when the Dark Prince wrote them on the backs of his most devout followers...

                The sun has just set over the horizon when Quint and his friends return to the Gray district to prepare for the raid on the temple of Asmodeus. They decide to keep up the ruse of being Asmodean agents from Cheliax, sent here to put an end to the excesses of Archbisshop Ornher Reebs. As they make their way south, they encounter a Gray Maiden patrol. The officer asks them what they are still doing out, so they pretend to have been celebrating the queen’s announcements. They lost track of time, but now they are on their way home. The soldiers buy their story and let them pass.
               </p>
               <p>
                The party heads straight for the rebel base and informs the rebel leaders of what they have learned. They plan on invading the temple of Asmodeus tonight, but they have come here to get ready. Vencarlo offers to join the young men and Illrem offers them the use of his arsenal, from which they can get some helmets to cover their faces. Next the heroes pay a visit to Keppira d’Bear in the temple of Pharasma. The high priestess has a number of spells prepared that can help the companions in their quest against Reebs and his devils, but she does not dare enter the temple of Asmodeus with them out of fear of blowing her cover: although Pharasma supports the rebellion in secret, the church is trying to uphold a neutral position in public. She prepares a
                <i>
                 heroes’ feast
                </i>
                and sends one of her men to the Marble Dome opera house, to get a number of Asmodean theater outfits. Cloaked in tabards, capes and holy symbols of the Lord of Hell, the party returns to the old courthouse, just outside of the star-shaped temple of Asmodeus. This is as far as Keppira d’Bear will go. She casts other buffs on the party:
                <i>
                 greater magic weapon
                </i>
                on Balian’s holy greatsword,
                <i>
                 magic vestment
                </i>
                ,
                <i>
                 protection from evil
                </i>
                and
                <i>
                 true seeing
                </i>
                on Quint,
                <i>
                 air walk
                </i>
                and
                <i>
                 align weapon
                </i>
                on Puk and
                <i>
                 magic circle versus evil
                </i>
                on Sjo.
               </p>
               <p>
                In the dead of night the party makes for the temple doors again. The Gray Maidens at the door let the ‘inquisitor’ and his bodyguards pass, as they were ordered to do by Tyresha. The church itself is abandoned, but Tyresha has put up a torch next to the door to the basement, showing the ‘inquisitor’ the way down. As they descend the stairs, the heroes pick up a sacrificial chant. Peeping around the corner, Puk sees a horrible scene.

                 A girl is being bled dry on a stone slab.

                Her blood flows into an enormous pool, in which several amorphous shapes with half-formed limbs and dripping tumorous faces mill about, mixing the sanguine fluid with their own blood. These hideous lemure devils are the lowliest of the low in the ranks of hell, but even their inferior life energy contains the taint of the infernal.

                <a href="http://mrvergee.deviantart.com/art/Asmodean-catacombs-blood-sarcifices-616082201" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
                 Two Gray Maidens complete the picture.
                </a>
                Quint sweeps into the room, taking up his role as inquisitor once again. He forbids the ritual, as it goes against the rules of this city. He wants to single out Ornher Reebs, but he notices the archbishop of Asmodeus is not here.
               </p>
               <p>
                The acolytes and even the Gray Maidens are taken aback by this sudden incursion, but the Erinyes are not fazed and open the fight. One of them casts
                <i>
                 fear
                </i>
                on Balian, but the buffs on the ranger aid him in shaking off the spell. A second Erinyes throws
                <i>
                 unholy blight
                </i>
                on the party, while a third wraps her entangling rope around Sjo. The fourth charges Quint from the left with her longsword. The bard ducks under the blade and mumbles the words of
                <i>
                 good hope
                </i>
                to further strengthen his friends. He also starts a
                <i>
                 satire
                </i>
                to throw his enemies off balance. Vencarlo, Puk and Spyder jump to Quint’s aid and engage the Erinyes, Balian wards off the Gray Maidens on the other side. One of them challenges him, but her swing misses him by an inch. Sjo tries to maintain his position in the center and boosts his companions with
                <i>
                 blessing of fervor
                </i>
                . Through his
                <i>
                 shield other
                </i>
                he also takes half of Balian’s damage. The Gray Maidens, obviously blood clones, still prove tough opponents, but they fall short against the well-prepared and thoroughly buffed ranger. They manage to give him some nasty cuts, but a
                <i>
                 fireball
                </i>
                and a critical sword swing later, one of them explodes in a spray of blood. Without her ally, the second maiden is severely at a disadvantage.
               </p>
               <p>
                In the meantime Quint has cast
                <i>
                 haste
                </i>
                and feinted one of the Erinyes, giving his friends there the opportunity to cut her down. From across the pool two Erinyes are still hurting the party with arrows and
                <i>
                 unholy blights
                </i>
                . One moment later a door to their right opens and the barbed devil joins the fray
                <a href="http://mrvergee.deviantart.com/art/Gray-Maiden-recruits-of-sacrifices-616081293" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
                 from what looks to be a prison block filled with young girls.
                </a>
                Another powerful opponent is not exactly good news, but Quint is happy to see that there is still a fair number of ‘recruits’ alive, making this rescue mission even more valuable. The barbed devil hurts the party with an alternative spell, that does not target ‘good’ characters, but rather ‘chaotic’ ones:
                <i>
                 order’s wrath
                </i>
                . Balian takes another hit before he can take out the second Gray Maiden and turns to face the barbed jailor. Sjo is hurting from his own wounds as well as from half of Balian’s, and gives himself some much required healing. Another
                <i>
                 unholy blight
                </i>
                on Vencarlo and Puk in the left flank takes down the halfling and leaves the sword master barely on his feet. With his flashing rapier Vencarlo kills a second Erinyes and stumbles back to Sjo’ side.
               </p>
               <p>
                The two Asmodean acolytes have not contributed anything to the fight so far, clearly being outmatched. One of them desperately prays to his god for aid as he stabs the sacrifice on the stone slab one more time, but the girl was already gone. The other one opens the left door, freeing the two wild otyughs who are there to dispose of the cadavers. One of the aberrations rewards the stupid priest by eating him alive, while the other monster turns on Sjo, who has is trying to patch up Vencarlo and Puk. The otuygh’s tentacle grabs hold of the healer, but now the monster opens itself up to sneak attacks by Puk and Vencarlo, cutting its life short.
               </p>
               <p>
                On the other side of the room Balian withstand a
                <i>
                 hold person
                </i>
                from the barbed devil and seriously hurts the infernal creature with three heavy blows. This being has probably lived a thousand lifetimes and knows when it is time to retreat, so it steps back and
                <i>
                 teleports
                </i>
                away. The two remaining Erinyes, who are now facing Puk and Balian, see how their more powerful ally has chosen to flee the scene and do the same. Quint walks up to the one acolyte who is still left and shouts at him: “Where is Reebs?” Totally intimidated the priest stumbles back: “Below us, in the cellar!” Then Spyder jumps at him and ends his miserable life. Puk and Balian take care of the second otuygh, while Quint decides to close the door to the cell block. He desperately wants to tell the caged girls they are free, but cannot spare the time as he wants his buffs to remain intact to confront Reebs. The party heals up and prepares to descend the stairs to deliver justice to Reebs.

                The stairs lead to the bowels of the crypts below the temple of Asmodeus.

                 A strange construct floats in the center of a burning five-pointed star.
                </a>
                The grim statue quietly hovers, its slow, seemingly weightless bobbing belying its obvious bulk. Sculpted in the shape of a grim, horned angel, gigantic wings and terrible, long clawed arms jut from a legless body that tapers into a blunt, blade-like trunk. Crucified upon the ominous form's breast hangs the drained body of Cressida Kroft, Korvosa’s field marshal. Five large vats stand in the points of the star; blood drips from the ceiling into these container. The crimson fluid churns and bubbles as it is slowly molded into human shape. The sanguine women are in different stages of development, with the most advanced specimen trying to tear loose from the scarlet goo. Off to the right is archbishop Ornher Reebs, the temple’s high priest, and his bodyguard Mallas.
               </p>
               <p>
                Quint still poses as an inquisitor of Asmodeus and forcefully orders Reebs to cease these bestialities immediately, as they go against Korvosan rule. Reebs is not fazed in the least by this display of jurisdiction, he is not opposing the law, as a matter of fact, he’s acting on behalf of the city’s highest authority, the queen herself. On top of that his practice, albeit somewhat unusual, fits perfectly in Asmodean doctrine: sacrifices for the greater good and promotion of Asmodeus’ devil kingdom. In vain Quint tries to contest Reebs’s claims, but the high priest simply calls out to his god: “Asmodeus, show us who is right here!” His bodyguard takes this as a clue to draw his sword, but the real response to the archbishop’s calling is given within the burning star:
                <a href="http://mrvergee.deviantart.com/art/Akaruzug-in-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-619030501" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
                 with a sudden jut the humongous statue snaps to life and two of the vats burst out into horrible humanoid shapes that ooze and weep blood from every part of their body; their hands end in sharpened claws.
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                These fresh blood wights are the first to act, charging Balian and Quint. Vencarlo tries to counter, but finds that his rapier has difficulty piercing the creatures’ viscous skin. Reebs calls a wall of swirling blades into existence on top of Vencarlo, Balian and Quint, cleverly cutting off Spyder, Puk and Sjo from the rest of the room. Fortunately the three heroes in the
                <i>
                 blade barrier
                </i>
                manage to jump out of harm’s way. Puk tumbles forward through the wall, relying on his roguish skills to avoid the hacking swords, and focuses his attacks on the same blood wight that Balian is targeting. Next the akaruzug flies closer, wipping its bladed underbody at Quint. The bard makes a converse movement and steps back to look for cover on the other side of the
                <i>
                 blade barrier
                </i>
                . He suffers some cuts, but now finds himself in a relatively safe position to cast spells and try to influence the battle. He boosts his friends with
                <i>
                 haste
                </i>
                and starts his
                <i>
                 satire
                </i>
                to debuff his enemies, using the infernal language to do so. It looks like his effort fails on the construct and on Mallas as well, who is probably too stupid to know the tongue of his patron deity. Sjo attempts to
                <i>
                 hold
                </i>
                the broad-shouldered bodyguard in place, but the temple warrior withstands the magic. Spyder joins the fight on the other side of the
                <i>
                 barrier
                </i>
                , but suffers the full strength of the blades while jumping through. The poor dog is badly hurt and its bad luck continues as both the akaruzug and Mallas bear down on it in full force. Mangled and bleeding from many wounds the canine drops to the floor. Ornher Reebs calls down a large pillar of fire on the center of combat, catching most heroes and the two blood wights in the flames. One of the latter does not survive the fire. The heroes now press the attack on its sibling, but the akaruzug claws and slashes its way through them without mercy, taking Puk down as well. Sjo heals his friends with a
                <i>
                 mass cure light wounds
                </i>
                and calls down his own
                <i>
                 flame strike
                </i>
                on Mallas and Reebs. At the same time Quint casts
                <i>
                 good hope
                </i>
                and drops his
                <i>
                 satire
                </i>
                in favor of
                <i>
                 inspire greatness
                </i>
                for Balian and Puk. The halfling’s luck picks up as he slips under Mallas’s fierce swing and Balian shares in the good fortune when his armor protects him from the blood wight’s claws. Vencarlo finally manages to finish the wight off, but still finds himself and his allies cornered by the hovering akaruzug. Puk uses his cloak’s
                <i>
                 dimension door
                </i>
                power to teleport himself, Balian and Vencarlo to the other side of the room, next to Reebs. The high priest has just enough time to summon a look of surprise and panic on his face, before the halfing’s daggers and Balian’s greatsword end his miserable existence. Sjo now manages to freeze Mallas in place with a
                <i>
                 hold person
                </i>
                , but just for a few seconds. Vencarlo darts around the floating construct, taking an attack of opportunity ‘for the team’, so he can provide flanking to Puk on Mallas. The fencing master gets hit even more by the akaruzug, but the seasoned warrior is tough and makes his stand. Mallas is not so lucky; when Puk and Balian charge him, he does not survive.
               </p>
               <p>
                Now the companions can at last focus on the flying statue. Quint uses his new
                <i>
                 dimension door
                </i>
                spell to zap Sjo and himself to the other side of the
                <i>
                 blade barrier
                </i>
                , where the healer can finally restore Puk’s faltering health. When the heroes deliver their first blows to the akaruzug, they notice that Cressida Kroft’s crucified body seems to share in the agony of the wounds. Balian activates his
                <i>
                 boots of flying
                </i>
                to take to the air and cleaves through the chain that binds the field marshal to the construct’s chest. His attempt succeeds and has an unexpected bonus. As the commander of the Korvosan Guard tumbles to the floor, the floating monstrosity suddenly freezes to a halt, giving the champions of Korvosa the opportunity to finish it off. Sjo heals the ailing field marshal and nurses her back to consciousness, although she still feels weak and hollow.
               </p>
               <p>
                The companions take a few moments to recover from the fight, gather some loot and brief Kroft. Then they head back to the floor with the cell block and free the imprisoned girls. After they reveal their true identity, some of the girls recognize them and realize they have indeed been saved. One of the prisoners is Aurelia Bromathan, niece to the leader of the rebellion, Illrem Bromathan. She is in a separate cell with eight other girls who look like they have been in here longer than the others. It turns out that they were considered ‘impure sacrifices’, as they have all given birth. (This confirms older rumors that Aurelia Bromathan, who disappeared from the city for a year, was indeed pregnant and shipped off to give birth the her ‘bastard’ in secret.) Quint convinces the girls to put on Gray Maiden armors, which are readily available in a well-stocked armory, so they can move through the city in disguise. He has no problem leading them past the guards at the front temple gate and after a quick stop at the old courthouse to pick up Keppira d’Bear, they make their way back to the Gray District. Using Puk, Balian and Vencarlo as scouts, the troop manages to avoid real Gray Maiden patrols and makes it to the other side of the city safely. When the finally reach the halls of the resistance, the companions get some much needed rest.

               <p>
                By the time the party gets up it is already past noon. Illrem calls the heroes into his makeshift office to thank them for rescuing his niece and get a full report on their rescue mission. When he learns about the infernal contract that Ileosa supposedly closed in the Acadamae, he is very worried. It seems that the queen has garnered even more superpower than the crown gives her. The leader of the resistance feels that this intel certainly deserves more attention. He summons Keppira d’Bear from the temple of Pharasma to shed some light on these diabolical dealings. The archbishop’s knowledge is limited, though. She knows that such deals are usually forged by contract devil, also known as Phistophili. Apart from taking care of hell’s bureaucracy, these devils seduce desperate, arrogant or foolish mortals to make a deal with Hell itself. Infernal contracts can provide several boons, but to gain those the mortal has to sign over his soul, dooming himself to eternal damnation after his death.
               </p>
               <p>
                While numerous types of infernal contracts exist, the following three are those most often offered to mortals:
               </p>
               <p>
                <ul>
                 <li>

                   Evil Wishes
                  </b>
                  : Upon signing this contract, a mortal is granted three
                  <i>
                   wishes
                  </i>
                  . While the mortal chooses the intention of the wishes, the contract devil decides upon the specifics, allowing for its own diabolical interpretation of the results should the mortal imprecisely phrase a wish.
                  <br/>
                  <li>
                   <b>
                    Hellbound heart
                   </b>
                   : The mortal ties the essence of a willing devil to his own, granting him diabolical powers to wield until the day that the mortal dies.
                   <br/>
                   <li>
                    <b>

                    : A mortal can negotiate with a contract devil for the lifelong service of a devil. Upon signing the contract, the mortal's infernal slave appears and is bound to do the mortal no harm and follow its orders for as long as it lives. Although the devil must obey its master's commands, many devils delight in corrupting the intentions of these orders in all manner of cruel or mischievous ways.

                Great update as always, MrVergee. I wonder where this stuff with the blood clones comes from. It isn't part of the actual AP, is it? So did you make it up on your own or was it proposed somewhere as a possible side trek? Blends in quite perfectly with the rest of the plot.

                Great update as always, MrVergee. I wonder where this stuff with the blood clones comes from. It isn't part of the actual AP, is it? So did you make it up on your own or was it proposed somewhere as a possible side trek? Blends in quite perfectly with the rest of the plot.

                 I ran with his idea because it provided several great opportunities:

                   <li>
                    It also allowed me to make the Gray Maidens more powerful (infusing them with Cressida Kroft's fighting abilities was my own idea), which gave me Gray Maidens who are strong enough to be a challenge to my PCs at their current level.
                    <br/>
                    <li>
                     It also underlines the scrupulous lengths Ileosa is willing to go through to build out her power.
                     <br/>
                     <li>
                      It gave me the chance to involve the church of Asmodeus.
                      <br/>
                      <li>
                       It served as an excellent element in my alternative adventures for

                 I think Moonbeam got his idea from the AP's last installment: the Everdawn Pool in the Sunken Queen. As I won't be using that chapter in my own campaign, the blood clone Gray Maiden alternative sounded perfect. I guess Star Wars might have had an influence as well ...

                After having found out the basics on infernal contracts from Keppira d’Bear, the companions realize that they need to learn more about these devilish dealings if they want to stand a chance against Ileosa. The temple of Asmodeus is their best bet, but the place will be in state of alert after last night’s raid, so getting more information from someone like priestess Tyresha will prove very tricky right now. The Acadamae probably houses a fair number of scholars who have a keen interest in the planes, but as the place is off limits to the public and closely guarded, it will prove even trickier than the temple of the Dark Prince. The Leroung library used to have a chamber dedicated to planar studies, but when the party was there two nights ago, they were told that imps had overrun the room and destroyed all tomes referring to Hell. So this is not a viable option either.
               </p>
               <p>
                They call in professor Sirtane Leroung to ask her who in the city were regular users of the library’s planar section. Unfortunately, she states that only Asmodeans and residents from the Acadamae frequented this particular reading room. So who else in Korvosa might know more about infernal contracts? The various devils themselves perhaps, but how would you go about getting them to talk? No, it feels like Korvosa will not offer this information freely. Balian suggests using the
                <i>
                 teleport
                </i>
                scroll to go to another city to gather this knowledge: Janderhoff, Kaer Maga or even somewhere in Cheliax itself. Quint rejects Balian’s idea, at least for the moment. The bard proposes to stake out the temple of Asmodeus to find out how things evolve there. He still sees the temple as his best option and feels it would be unwise to simply dismiss this possibility without making sure it truly is impossible.
               </p>
               <p>
                The bard also remembers Illrem Bromathan’s plea for help to free his sister-in-law and nephew from their home, where they have been placed under house arrest. Since the party’s first ‘rescue mission’ at the Leroung house didn’t end so well, it seems like a good idea to stake out the Bromathan villa as well, before actually moving in to free the prisoners. Illrem provides the heroes with a sketch of the house and looks pleased that the party will heed his personal request, as the truly fears for the safety of his kin.
               </p>
               <p>
                The companions decide to use the rest of the day for scouting. Sjo and Quint will watch the temple of Asmodeus, while Puk and Balian will keep their eyes on the Bromathan villa. Traveling to these two destinations will take them to the northwest and northeast of the city respectively. This means they have to part ways at the Gold Market, so they might as well have dinner there first in one of the restaurants. After all, it is no fun staking out a place on an empty stomach.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Gold Market is unexpectedly booming with activity. A large crowd has gathered in front of a podium. Asking around, the companions find out that there will be a free theatrical performance, with free food and drink to boot. It looks like Ileosa is working hard on her public relations with another offering of bread and games. Deciding that they don’t mind paying for a good meal, the companions find a great spot on the terrace of the exclusive King’s Table restaurant, from where they have a good, albeit somewhat distant view on the stage. Only moments later the play begins.

                The opening scene shows Eodred’s harem: beautiful girls who keep the king occupied. After an exotic dance a smart-dressed man with a haughty attitude walks in and sends the girls away. It is the seneschal. The kings asks how his people are doing. Kalepopolis assures him that all is well and that his subjects are happy. The king does not need to worry, his seneschal has everything under control.

                Kalepopolis retreats to his chambers where he meets up with the Chelish ambassador Amprei. Amprei offers the seneschal a painting of a nude young woman, which Kalepopolis likes very much. He is especially fond of her boyish looks. Amprei claims it is a self-portrait of an up-and-coming new artist, named Trinia Sabor. Knowing the seneschal’s love of the arts, he is willing to introduce the two in exchange for his help. He wants to have the king sign a new decree, forcing poor people who can’t pay their taxes into slavery, as is the custom for halflings in Cheliax. Slavery will offer great business opportunities, as will the property market: slaves will be forced out of their homes and these empty houses will be up for grabs.
               </p>
               <p>
                Kalepopolis likes the deviousness of Amprei’s plans, but he seriously doubts Eodred will sign such a decree: the kind-hearted king loves his people too much. Amprei says he has already thought of that. He calls in a woman whom he introduces as Lady Andaisin, high priestess of Urgathoa. She can brew a potion that will make the king do anything they want. They will simply have one of his harem girls slip the potion to him. Kalepopolis is easily convinced, but says they will have to wait until after the Founding Festival tomorrow, for the can hardly send a drugged king into the city to greet its citizens.

                During his ride through the city on Founding Day, the king sees how a young noblewoman from Cheliax gets thrown off her horse and he saves her from being trampled. He learns her name, Ileosa, and offers to take her to his castle to have her rest. A mother with a small ginger-haired child watches as the king and the noblewoman ride off. “She is beautiful, isn’t she, mother?” the boy says. “She is, Tommy, she truly is”, the mother replies.

                 There is something strangely familiar about Ileosa’s voice and countenance. Studying her closer Puk sees that she looks and sounds exactly like Dame Nesia, the blood clone experiment who lived with the companions for a time before she exploded in a pool of blood. This woman must be Nesia’s original!

                Kalepopolis is talking to Amprei and Andaisin. The seneschal is furious: Eodred has sent his harem away because he is infatuated with this new girl. The king has also decided to take a more active interest in ruling the city to impress his new conquest. Without the harem the conspirators won’t be able to slip the king the potion. Amprei admits this is a great setback. Now they will have to find another way to force the poor out of their houses, so he can buy big building blocks cheaply. But Kalepopolis needn’t worry, Andaisin has more tricks up her sleeve. After all, the best weapon against a woman with a gentle soul, is a woman with an evil one.

                Kalepopolis has another meeting with Amprei and Andaisin. The seneschal is malcontent because he has lost a lot of influence over the last five years, since Eodred and Ileosa got married. The queen has made Eodred a better man and king, thwarting the conspirators’ plans. Amprei whole-heartedly agrees, although he has the funds to buy up land in Korvosa’s poorer quarters, prices are still too high. Andaisin says Urgathoa has the answer: the king will have to be killed. She takes out a potion bottle with a big white skull painted on it. But who will give it to the king? Kalepopolis smiles, he knows just the person. After all, it is high time the king adds his portrait to the gallery of monarchs.

                Eodred and Ileosa are in their chambers, joking about what pose the king should assume on his portrait. Eodred wants Ileosa to be on the portrait with him, but she kindly refuses, saying tradition demands a state portrait of the monarch by himself. Then Kalepopolis interrupts, walking in with the artist, Trinia Sabor. Ileosa kindly greets her, but Trinia scoffs at her and demands to be alone with his majesty: there can be no distractions.

                Ileosa is talking to Kalepopolis. She is concerned for the king. Trinia has kept him locked up in his room for weeks now. Ileosa feels her husband should come out for some fresh air, the current situation is not healthy for him and it has also kept him from doing his royal duties. Kalepopolis wipes the queen’s worries under the rug. Eodred is just getting older, he claims, and Korvosa does not need him to exert himself; Kalepopolis is perfectly capable of taking those heavy duties off the king’s hands. Ileosa disagrees, she wants to take Eodred out for a walk on the terrace, but Kalepopolis blocks her way. “Not yet,” he grunts, “be patient, my queen, Trinia will finish her business soon enough!”

                After Ileosa leaves, Andaisin crawls out from behind the curtain. She asks Kalepopolis why the king still isn’t dead. The seneschal says he might have misjudged Eodred’s charm, he fears the silly painter has fallen in love with the king.

                Trinia puts the final touches on Eodred’s portrait. She walks up to the king and gives him a hug. Then she tries to kiss him, but he wards her off, saying those frivolous days are long behind him. He is happily married now. Trinia is obviously disappointed and asks the king if they can at least toast to the finished portrait. Eodred accepts. Trinia secretly pulls out the poison and pours it in Eodred’s drink. Then they empty their glasses and Eodred drops to the floor. The king is dead.

                Ileosa runs into the throne room and falls to her knees, crying because her husband is dead. Kalepopolis follows a few moments later, saying “so it goes”. People grow old and then they die. Then he sits down on the throne, shouting: “The king is dead, long live the king!” As Ileosa looks up in despair, he smirks at her. If she is a good girl, he might find some room in his bed for her. “Never”, Ileosa screams in reply. The seneschal jumps to his feet again and draws his weapon. He claims that in ancient civilizations, wives joined deceased kings in the grave. Maybe it is time to revive these customs. He walks up to Ileosa threateningly, but Sabina Merrin shows up just in time to parry his blade. She wounds Kalepopolis badly and the man flees, swearing this is not over yet.

He tells them his plans to usurp the throne have failed: they underestimated Ileosa and her protector Merrin. Lady Andaisin calls this only a minor setback. All the conspirators have to do is prove to the people of Korvosa that Ileosa can’t rule. Urgathoa will help them, she claims. She just needs some time to prepare a very devious plan, nothing short of a ‘masterpiece’. Meanwhile she wants her allies to undermine the queen’s authority. Kalepopolis cries he can’t do anything for now, he’s badly wounded! He will seek refuge with his Sable Company brothers to get well first. So it’s up to Amprei, who promises to do what he can to incite the people to rebel against Ileosa.

Suddenly they come across a group of people who are protesting against Ileosa (or the “Chelish wh*re”, as the call her); Amprei and Trinia are in the first ranks, shouting the hardest. Korvosan guards try to calm the demonstrators down, but Trinia draws a knife and skewers a guard. Sabina Merrin arrives on the scene, cradles the stabbed guard in her arms as he dies and then tells the protestors to return home. Amprei tries to stab her in the back while she is trying to defuse the situation. She manages to sidestep his vicious attack, knocks him out and then she draws her sword and holds it to Trinia’s throat. She arrests the painter while she sends the rest of the rabble home. When everyone has left the scene, Little Tommy and his mother remain behind. Tommy asks his mother what a “wh*re” is. She claims it is hard to explain, but whatever it is, she is sure Ileosa isn’t one. “What is she, then?” the boy wonders. “She is the one who is going to take care of all of us, as queens do”, his mother assures him.

She tries to show some sympathy for Trinia, but the painter blames Ileosa for everything and refuses to show any remorse. With a heavy heart Ileosa condemns her to death.

Trinia mocks the priestess: “You’re going to take down the queen with rats? How will you do that?” “Like this”, Andaisin replies, as she lets go of the rat, who runs over to Trinia and bites the girl. Trinia is shocked and runs for the door. Kalepopolis intends to stop her, but Andaisin orders him to let her go. If the people don’t kill her, the rat bite certainly will, she smirks.

Marco does not know who wrote the play, explaining that the piece was provided by the magistrate of Expenditures, Syl Gar, who also hired the cast. He can tell Quint the name of the woman who played Ileosa, however, Elvira Campert, a student from the Acadamae. She is in the building behind him, which has been confiscated to act as the dressing rooms for the cast. Quint makes his way inside the house and finds Elvira in an upstairs bedroom, where she is removing her make-up. She has taken off her red Ileosa wig,

                . Now there is no denying it anymore, she is the spitting image of Dame Nesia! Quint introduces himself as a fellow actor and Elvira recognizes him from

                </i>
                , which she claims to have seen. This is actually her first time on stage, she explains, and Quint showers her with compliments on her performance. She confirms that she is a student at the Acadamae, the Hall of Charm to be exact. As an arcanist specialized in enchantment, she has always felt a great affinity for the theatre, even though she never actively pursued this profession. She claims that she was asked to play the part of Ileosa by ‘the castle’. When Quint pushes her to expound, she tells him that she has no real connections in the castle, apart from the new seneschal, Togomor, who is also the head of the transmutation department in the Acadamae. Although she did not study under him, the professor had a soft spot for her and tried to woo her in the past, without success. The man is powerful, which some girls might find attractive, but not Elvira. She is even repulsed by his appearance, which makes Quint smile. Togomor is not a good-looking man by any standards: old, balding and fat with a greasy skin. Not the type a pretty girl would fall for. Quint on the other hand is a handsome devil, and he feels that there is a spark between him and Elvira. He asks her if he can see her again. She says she would like that, but it is hard to get out of the Acadamae. She’s not sure if there are going to be other performances of the play, none have been planned so far. So she asks Quint where she can find him, if she manages to get out. Since the bard can hardly tell Elvira he is staying at the resistance hide-out, he has to resort to quick thinking, claiming he is staying at

                 The Hell Mother

                , but she does not remember him. The bard is not surprised, recalling that Greta was ‘high’ when they met. Before he slips out, Quint manages to grab one of the cotton pads Elvira used to remove her make-up. This might be useful to scry on her in the future.
